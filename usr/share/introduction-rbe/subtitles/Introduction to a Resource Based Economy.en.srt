00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.626
The Venus Project is a veritable blueprint for the genesis

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.580
of a new world civilization

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.346
based on human concern and environmental reclamation.

00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:15.260
It proposes a holistic social design in which automation

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.780
and technology will be intelligently integrated

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:22.986
to maximize the quality of life, rather than simply profits.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.100
Undesirable behaviors are products of long exposure

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.066
to detrimental environments.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.760
If we wish to surpass the limitations of our present-day society,

00:00:35.984 --> 00:00:40.272
such as war, hunger, poverty, and bigotry,

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:46.096
we need to make changes and arrange society very differently.

00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:49.520
Most of our problems today are technical,

00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:53.760
but we still look for solutions through political means

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:56.224
in a monetary system.

00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:01.850
We have the resources. Money is an interference

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.900
because it limits our ability, and it limits our dreams.

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:10.576
Modern society has access to highly advanced technologies

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.624
and can make available food, clothing, housing,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.730
medical care, a relevant educational system,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.101
and at the same time develop a limitless supply

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.627
of renewable clean energy, such as geothermal,

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:27.940
tidal, solar, wind, and more.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.886
The solutions lie in the intelligent and humane application

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:37.930
of science and technology, and more appropriate resource management

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.181
in order to supply goods and services to everyone equitably,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.984
enabling the entire global population

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.993
a very high standard of living.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.027
We don't have enough money to accomplish this

00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:55.526
but we do have enough resources

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.498
if we initiate what Jacque Fresco calls 'A Resource Based Economy.'

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.090
This is where all goods and services are available to everyone

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.130
without money, credit, barter, or servitude of any kind.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.260
For this to be attained, all resources must be declared

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.070
as the common heritage of all the Earth's people.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.340
Imagine the possibilities of an unprecedented mobilization

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.220
of scientific and technical alliances toward problem solving,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.610
without the interference of money or politics,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.970
to initiate global unification and restoration.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.390
The Venus Project would start with a systems approach to city design

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.000
using highly effective construction methods,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.280
emphasizing the conservation of resources.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.266
The first city would be a huge research center

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.760
making automated systems for the next city. It would be

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.133
a place where we would disseminate information as to what

00:03:02.246 --> 00:03:04.250
sustainability really means for the future.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.920
The aim of the city is to constantly maximize existing

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.010
and future technologies, with the sole purpose

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.166
of enhancing all human life

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.960
and protecting the environment.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.230
The society that I'm talking about is global cooperation,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.100
where all the nations work toward improving the lot of humankind.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.630
Now why do that? Because the smarter people are,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.490
the richer and more secure everybody is!

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.360
We have the tools at hand to design and build a future

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.260
that is worthy of the human potential.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.240
It is imperative that we continue the process of social experimentation

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.930
in order to transcend our present limitations and truly create

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.600
the beginning of a civilized age.
