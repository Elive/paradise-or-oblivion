1
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:17,345
The entire money-structured
and materialistic-oriented society

2
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,181
is a false society.

3
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:23,403
Our society will go down in history
as the lowest development in man.

4
00:00:23,543 --> 00:00:26,817
We have the brains, the know-how,
the technology

5
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:30,914
and the feasibility
to build an entirely new civilization.

6
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:51,917
(Jacque Fresco)
It was living through
the 1929 Great Depression

7
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:55,557
that helped shape
my social conscience.

8
00:00:56,503 --> 00:01:00,873
During this time, I realized
the Earth was still the same place:

9
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:06,283
manufacturing plants were still intact
and resources were still there

10
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:11,093
but people didn't have the money
to buy the products.

11
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:15,059
I felt that the rules of the game
we play by

12
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:18,276
were obsolete and insufficient.

13
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:25,423
Misery, suffering and war
provided the incentive for my life's work.

14
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:30,771
I was also motivated by
the seeming incompetence of governments

15
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:36,210
the academic world, and the lack of solutions
offered by scientists.

16
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:40,738
I realized that instead of working
with individuals

17
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:45,813
a more effective method would be
to redesign the culture.

18
00:01:47,158 --> 00:01:51,524
This began a lifelong quest
to finding solutions

19
00:01:51,664 --> 00:01:55,141
to the many problems
that we have today.

20
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:06,020
(Narrator)
This presentation
is a feasible plan for social change

21
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,670
that works toward a peaceful
and sustainable global civilization

22
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:15,586
where human beings,
technology and nature coexist.

23
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:21,020
It outlines an alternative
to strive for

24
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,016
where human rights
are not only paper proclamations

25
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,223
but a way of life.

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,378
It is called The Venus Project.

27
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:42,246
Its founder, Jacque Fresco

28
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:46,684
calls for a straightforward redesign
of the culture in which war

29
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,700
poverty, hunger, debt
and unnecessary human suffering

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,565
are viewed not only as avoidable
but totally unacceptable.

31
00:02:58,203 --> 00:03:01,807
It is becoming increasingly obvious
that anything less

32
00:03:01,947 --> 00:03:07,650
will simply result in a continuation
of the same problems we face today.

33
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:25,060
The Venus Project's research center

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,506
constructed by Fresco and Roxanne Meadows

35
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:31,293
is located in Venus, Florida.

36
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:35,805
It addresses many of the root causes
of our difficulties.

37
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:39,791
But what are the real origins
of our problems?

38
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:55,037
At present, we are left
with very few alternatives

39
00:03:55,178 --> 00:03:59,123
since we are on a collision course
of our own making.

40
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:04,408
Answers from yesterday
are no longer relevant.

41
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:10,367
Considering the damage already done
to the environment

42
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:13,961
we are rapidly approaching
a point of no return

43
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:17,579
where nature will dictate the course.

44
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,753
Either we continue as we have

45
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:24,494
with outmoded social customs
and habits of thought

46
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:27,361
thereby threatening our future

47
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,509
or, we apply
a more appropriate set of values

48
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,304
relevant to a sustainable society

49
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:37,302
with more opportunity and freedoms.

50
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:43,779
Americans have been conditioned
in their kind of society

51
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,935
to get a different kind of car next year

52
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:48,441
to buy a new television set,
or a tape recorder.

53
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,982
We are radical as hell but our political
and social institutions

54
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:56,110
have not changed
and this is where we are stagnating:

55
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,651
because we always equate any new idea
with communism or regimentation

56
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,933
because we have been brought up
to fear that which is new.

57
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,631
(Narrator)
None of the world's economic systems:

58
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:13,698
socialism, communism, fascism
or the free enterprise system

59
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:19,328
have eliminated the problems of elitism,
nationalism, racism

60
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:23,024
and most of all, scarcity.

61
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:28,976
These are all based primarily
on economic disparity.

62
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:33,501
When money is used to regulate
and distribute resources for profit

63
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:36,416
and people and nations
are out for themselves

64
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:39,058
they will seek advantage at any cost.

65
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:42,597
They do this by maintaining
a competitive edge

66
00:05:42,738 --> 00:05:46,177
or through military intervention.

67
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:52,135
War represents the supreme failure of nations
to resolve their differences.

68
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:55,232
From a strictly pragmatic standpoint

69
00:05:55,373 --> 00:06:00,533
it is the most inefficient waste of lives
and resources ever conceived.

70
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:05,072
Most wars
are for the control of resources

71
00:06:05,212 --> 00:06:08,586
and maintaining your position
of differential advantage.

72
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:11,590
They're not based on
the 'dignity of man.'

73
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,552
They're not based on
elevating human beings.

74
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:18,342
It might elevate the human beings
in the country that's the victor.

75
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:22,101
It might do that.
But as far as the rest of the world goes

76
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:23,825
the price is enormous.

77
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:29,426
(Narrator)
This crude and violent attempt
to resolve international differences

78
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:32,457
takes on even more ominous overtones

79
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:36,287
with the advent
of computerized nuclear delivery systems

80
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:39,307
and deadly biological
and chemical weapons.

81
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:47,931
Yet it is a windfall,
money-making opportunity

82
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:52,176
for those who profit
by the military-industrial complex.

83
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,498
If the profit were taken out of wars

84
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:59,854
do you really believe
we would have them?

85
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:03,633
(Jacque Fresco)
If they draft you
into the army to serve this country

86
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:06,102
(you put up your life
for this country)

87
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,991
they should draft
all the war industries:

88
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:12,094
every cannon maker,
machine gun maker

89
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:15,125
automobiles, jeeps,
warships

90
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:20,125
all drafted,
so they're on the same basis of pay as the army.

91
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:24,408
Then it's real.
But if you make millions selling warships

92
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:27,658
and machine guns to the army,
then it's corrupt.

93
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,038
I would (if I had my way),
if we had millions of men in the army

94
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:36,618
I'd send them to school
to become problem solvers

95
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:41,397
how to get along with other nations.
That's what we have to do, not kill.

96
00:07:41,645 --> 00:07:45,871
Soldiers are just killing machines;
they're trained to kill.

97
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:53,695
I would train them to be able to go to Mexico
and bridge the difference

98
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:57,371
and go to the Arab world
and see if they can bridge the difference.

99
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:00,285
So bring them all together,
all the nations.

100
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:07,331
(Narrator)
War is not the only form of violence
imposed upon people.

101
00:08:07,573 --> 00:08:10,794
There is also hunger, poverty

102
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:14,136
homelessness and unemployment.

103
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:20,726
The acceptance of these conditions
as expressive of 'human nature' is a myth

104
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:23,269
used to keep things as they are.

105
00:08:29,604 --> 00:08:34,682
Genetics has nothing to do with greed,
business, race prejudice.

106
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:40,251
All of the operant systems in any society
are part of your education

107
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,813
the books you read, the role models you follow
and the people you admire.

108
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:48,012
The genes have nothing to do...

109
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:51,820
except with the color of your eyes,
the shape of your nose

110
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,977
perhaps inherited features.

111
00:08:56,734 --> 00:09:00,505
The genes do not control values.

112
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:08,265
Even if you're born with a much better brain
than another person

113
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:12,454
meaning better receptors,
the quality of the tissue is better

114
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:15,668
I would say that
if you have a better brain

115
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:20,739
and you live in a fascist country
you become a fascist faster.

116
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,576
The brain
has no mechanism of discrimination.

117
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:29,075
The brain can't tell you
what is relevant or less relevant

118
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,453
except experience.

119
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:39,257
(Narrator)
We are not born with greed,
envy, hatred, or bigotry.

120
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:46,168
Our behavior and values
are reflective of the culture we are exposed to.

121
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,221
If you were raised
by the headhunters of the Amazon

122
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:54,221
you'd be a headhunter.

123
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:58,529
If I said to you
&quot;Doesn't it bother you to have 5 shrunken heads?&quot;

124
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:01,786
you'd say
&quot;Yes, my brother has 20.&quot;

125
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:07,182
Is he nuts?
No, that's normal to his culture.

126
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:14,622
Social and environmental problems
will remain insurmountable

127
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:18,513
as long as few nations control
most of the Earth's resources

128
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:22,953
and the bottom line is profit
over the well-being of people.

129
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:26,824
Putting profit first results in
unnecessary suffering

130
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,745
and aberrant behavior
prevalent today.

131
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:38,475
Many people feel that we need
the rule of law to eliminate our problems.

132
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:42,008
We have many laws,
thousands upon thousands of them

133
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:45,200
but they are constantly being broken.

134
00:10:45,794 --> 00:10:51,035
Paper proclamations and treaties
do not alter the facts of scarcity

135
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:53,365
deprivation, and insecurity.

136
00:10:56,664 --> 00:11:01,794
You can predict the shape of the future
and the values if you know

137
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:07,476
the trends of events in the ocean pollution,
the scarcity of arable land...

138
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:11,071
If you watch that degrading system grow

139
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:15,841
I can predict the riots
and killing and assassination.

140
00:11:15,981 --> 00:11:20,317
Human behavior is really generated
by the surrounding environment.

141
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:26,314
If there's a scarcity, say of water,
it is prized and its price is high.

142
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,443
Let's discuss scarcity
as a system.

143
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:34,264
Suppose it rained gold
for about 3 days, gold dust.

144
00:11:34,404 --> 00:11:36,829
People would go out and shovel it in,
fill their cellars

145
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:40,075
the attic, every drawer in the house.
They'd throw out their clothing.

146
00:11:40,215 --> 00:11:44,721
If the rain kept up for a year
so that gold was all over the place

147
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:48,729
people would sweep it out of the house,
take their rings off, throw them away

148
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:52,640
and so human behavior
undergoes change to that condition.

149
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,395
There's only a policeman
in front of something that people have need for

150
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:02,096
and don't have access to,
so you put a guard there.

151
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:05,271
But if lemon trees or
orange trees and apple trees

152
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:08,266
grew all over the place,
you couldn't sell it.

153
00:12:08,618 --> 00:12:12,277
If you landed on an island
that was so abundant with resources

154
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:16,683
you had 10 people, there were 1000 fish
for every person if you wanted it,

155
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:19,617
there were 10 times
the amount of breadfruit and bananas

156
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:21,833
money would not come into existence.

157
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:24,760
Private property
would not come into existence.

158
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,228
If the island was big enough:
there were 10 people, there were 8000 acres

159
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:33,729
no one would give a damn
about staking out this particular area.

160
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,294
There are patterns of behavior
that promote survival.

161
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:42,415
There are social conditions
that change our values and outlook.

162
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:47,800
No one can write
a constitution of required behavior

163
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,088
without consulting the environment.

164
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:54,017
So, we'd better take care
of the environment

165
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:58,234
we'd better take care of one another
and we'd better educate people

166
00:12:58,374 --> 00:13:01,764
to the highest possible levels
of our ability

167
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:03,790
in order to have a society.

168
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,990
(Narrator)
Even a peace treaty
cannot prevent another war

169
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,385
if the underlying causes
are not dealt with.

170
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,645
Maybe what are needed
are ethical people in government

171
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:19,695
who will work toward
everyone's well-being.

172
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:24,707
But even if the most ethical people
were elected to high positions

173
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:28,630
and we ran out of resources,
there would still be lying

174
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:31,829
cheating, stealing and corruption.

175
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:35,468
It's not ethical people
that are needed but rather

176
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:40,809
a way of intelligently managing
the Earth's resources for everyone's well-being.

177
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:54,542
Let's examine
our social arrangements further.

178
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:01,462
To maintain our economy,
products must continuously be sold.

179
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:08,051
To assure this, they are deliberately designed
to wear out and break down.

180
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,166
Maybe you've noticed
this usually happens

181
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:14,712
right after the warranty expires.

182
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:22,122
This corrupt practice
is referred to as 'planned obsolescence'

183
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:25,821
which is the conscious withdrawal
of efficiency.

184
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,187
Innovators go through the finest schools
and then are required

185
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:37,035
to design things that wear out
and break down right on schedule.

186
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:42,982
This results in a tremendous waste
of resources and energy.

187
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:48,987
We are plundering the planet
for profits.

188
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:55,672
If you think about it,
it isn't a job people want

189
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,787
but access
to what their paycheck will bring.

190
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:02,276
Money does not represent anything real

191
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:06,179
and there's no gold,
silver or resource to back it up.

192
00:15:09,753 --> 00:15:12,528
You can't eat money
or build a house of it.

193
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:14,904
It is not even related
to our real capacity

194
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:18,173
to produce goods and services
on this planet.

195
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:22,629
The monetary system
has been handed down from centuries ago

196
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:26,016
and we continue to use it
without questions.

197
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:37,354
This system will keep installing
more and more automation

198
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:40,816
cutting down on the purchasing power
of the majority of people.

199
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:44,191
There will come a time
(it's called the Gaussian curve)

200
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:47,485
where employment is that,
production is this

201
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:50,999
and purchasing power is that.
The system stops.

202
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:53,610
Banks fail
and nothing works anymore.

203
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,522
We're moving in that direction
very rapidly.

204
00:15:56,977 --> 00:16:01,887
- We have finally gotten to a place
in 2011

205
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,394
where it's becoming obvious
that the machine has beaten the man.

206
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:09,897
- We are incredibly productive
with far fewer people.

207
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:12,792
- We are more productive as an economy
than ever before.

208
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:16,079
- An iPad app can do more
than four people.

209
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,941
- It's just that there are fewer jobs.
The jobs that do exist now

210
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:21,403
can have lower wages
because of obvious reasons:

211
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:24,132
a lot of people are looking for
a small number of jobs.

212
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:26,941
The wages go down,
that has huge impacts on the middle class

213
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:28,754
and ripples out from there.

214
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:31,432
We're moving towards social collapse.

215
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:34,859
I think this is going to happen
all over the world, not just here.

216
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:37,681
It doesn't require
the overthrow of the government.

217
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:42,149
It just requires that you let it alone;
it will overthrow itself.

218
00:16:42,289 --> 00:16:45,736
If you control the media,
you can calm people down.

219
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:50,134
But if the majority keeps getting laid off,
they don't have purchasing power

220
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:53,823
the system collapses.
It doesn't work anymore; they invade.

221
00:16:53,963 --> 00:16:58,491
It's already happening,
this country is already insoluble.

222
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:03,579
They're going to have difficulty
with national security, paying pension people:

223
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:07,116
they've spent far beyond
what they already have.

224
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:11,788
All they can do now is create debt,
borrow more and more money from banks.

225
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,981
- We also want to show you
a rather grim sign of our times

226
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,389
it's not far from here
in Midtown Manhattan.

227
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:22,580
The national debt has grown too large
for the National Debt Clock.

228
00:17:22,721 --> 00:17:24,513
It went up back in 1989

229
00:17:24,654 --> 00:17:27,934
when the nation's debt
was less than 3 trillion dollars.

230
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:33,149
The debt has been piling up so fast lately
they had to drop the dollar sign

231
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:36,729
to make room for an extra digit
as the number turned over

232
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:41,970
to more than ten trillion dollars now
and counting every second.

233
00:17:42,164 --> 00:17:46,979
A whole new clock with two extra spaces
will go up next year.

234
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,838
The federal government
is not allowed to print money.

235
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:54,265
It's not allowed to lend money
or get in the banking business.

236
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:57,023
That is a privilege
for bankers only.

237
00:17:57,163 --> 00:18:00,477
So what the government has to do
if they want to build an air force

238
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:02,298
say of 2000 planes a month

239
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:06,163
they have to borrow money
from a private lending institution

240
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:09,986
sign the dotted line,
and if the war is lost or failed

241
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:13,796
the burden falls on the public
to pay off that debt.

242
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:40,641
(Narrator)
We find ourselves
and our social constructs

243
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:44,957
in a transitional state,
a matter of social evolution.

244
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:47,776
If we want to make it
through these turbulent times

245
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,646
we must be able
to adapt to change.

246
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:55,855
All things change,
including our social systems.

247
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,393
Albert Einstein stated:

248
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,298
Earth is still abundant
with resources.

249
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:15,890
Our practice of rationing resources
through monetary control

250
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:21,568
is no longer relevant and is actually counterproductive
to our very survival.

251
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:26,887
Today we have highly advanced technologies

252
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:32,248
but our social and economic system
has not kept up with our technological capabilities

253
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:36,192
which could otherwise easily create
a world of abundance for all

254
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,506
free of servitude and debt.

255
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:41,362
How can this be possible?

256
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,810
There is not enough money
to feed or house all people on this planet

257
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,018
let alone accomplish
these more ambitious ends.

258
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:55,375
But Earth has more than enough resources
to meet the needs of all people

259
00:19:56,123 --> 00:19:59,051
but only if managed intelligently.

260
00:20:09,004 --> 00:20:12,033
(Narrator)
Jacque Fresco envisions a solution
that he calls

261
00:20:12,174 --> 00:20:14,196
a Resource-Based Economy.

262
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:17,792
It is a socio-economic system
in which all goods and services

263
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:21,759
are available to everyone
without the use of money

264
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:26,551
barter, credit,
debt or servitude of any kind.

265
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,828
It is unlike any social system
that has gone before.

266
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:34,712
Fresco arrived at this direction
through 75 years of study

267
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:37,664
and experimental research.

268
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:48,029
A Resource-Based Economy
operates on the basis of available resources

269
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,367
and makes those resources available
to every human being on earth

270
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:55,318
free of charge,
without a price tag.

271
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,123
We have today
more than enough resources

272
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,291
to build a far more advanced society.

273
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:06,803
I'm not talking about limited handouts
so that people just get by.

274
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,533
I'm talking about
a very advanced civilization.

275
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:14,339
We have the resources, we have the technology,
all we have to do is apply it.

276
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:17,351
(Roxanne Meadows)
One of the main aspects
of The Venus Project

277
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:22,817
is to eliminate scarcity;
this is where the technology comes into play.

278
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:25,251
Because if we set up
a Resource-Based Economy

279
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:28,093
and some things are scarce,
it won't work.

280
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:30,466
If you set up a Resource-Based Economy

281
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:34,183
in a society that has no resources,
it won't work.

282
00:21:34,323 --> 00:21:38,009
Today with our technology
we can make things available.

283
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:42,004
We can eliminate scarcity,
we can create an abundance.

284
00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:46,668
As long as we can create that abundance,
that will eliminate greed

285
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:51,408
and selfishness, and a lot of crime
and a lot of aberrant behavior.

286
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,612
(Narrator)
A social system can be designed

287
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:58,400
so that all can live fully
and constructively

288
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:03,694
if the powers of science and technology are directed
toward human and environmental concern

289
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:09,145
and overcoming the artificial scarcities
of our debt-based monetary systems.

290
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,176
All people, regardless of political philosophy,
social customs

291
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:19,637
or religious differences
ultimately depend upon the same resources:

292
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,173
clean air and water

293
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,289
arable land

294
00:22:24,828 --> 00:22:28,667
medical care and a relevant education.

295
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:35,894
I think if you pledge allegiance
to the Earth and everyone on it

296
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,910
that'd be the way to go for the future.

297
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:44,052
(Narrator)
The human species is a single family
and the world is home to everyone.

298
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:48,733
Neither nations nor people
can co-exist separately any longer.

299
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:53,112
No more separate nations,
so that anyone can go anywhere.

300
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:57,969
Before the states joined together,
they used to stake out their territory.

301
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:01,039
They used to fight, they had militias.
They would fight:

302
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,169
&quot;This is our territory!&quot;
&quot;Oh no you're intruding!&quot;

303
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:06,831
When all the states joined together,
the government

304
00:23:06,972 --> 00:23:10,139
worked out the lines of the states
and they agreed.

305
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:13,368
That was the end of territorial disputes.

306
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:18,846
If you want the end of war,
you must declare the Earth common heritage.

307
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:33,617
This has nothing to do with those
who want to form an elite world order

308
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:37,524
with themselves and large corporations
in control

309
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:40,994
and the rest of the world
subservient to them.

310
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:44,859
On the contrary,
a global Resource-Based Economy

311
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:48,523
enables all people
to reach their highest potential

312
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:53,296
where they can thrive and grow
in a society that works in their behalf

313
00:23:53,878 --> 00:23:58,131
a society that protects
and preserves the environment as well.

314
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:03,613
One that understands that we are part of nature,
not separate from it.

315
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:16,342
(Narrator)
Some question what would happen to incentive
if needs were met

316
00:24:16,482 --> 00:24:19,157
without our having to work
to attain them.

317
00:24:19,297 --> 00:24:23,399
The question assumes humans
have no desires beyond basic needs.

318
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:27,124
If that were true,
there would be no inventors

319
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:30,226
writers or teachers.

320
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:34,463
People work with passion
on the things that interest and challenge them.

321
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:37,046
Let's enable all people
to have the opportunity

322
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:40,059
to partake in the greatest challenge
one can have:

323
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:43,012
improving our world for everyone.

324
00:24:44,912 --> 00:24:48,993
Individuality will be emphasized
rather than uniformity.

325
00:24:49,502 --> 00:24:52,829
This social arrangement will generate
a new incentive system

326
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:56,576
that values the protection of the environment
and social concern

327
00:24:56,716 --> 00:24:59,097
rather than the shallow self-centered goals

328
00:24:59,237 --> 00:25:02,019
of wealth, property and power.

329
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:08,554
It does not call for uniformity.
It absolutely calls for diversity:

330
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:12,324
the more diverse people are,
the more individuality.

331
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:17,688
So we emphasize individuality,
creativity, innovativeness.

332
00:25:17,829 --> 00:25:20,469
This is the essentials of the design.

333
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:23,939
It is not a group of scientists
telling people what to do

334
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,712
how to live, where to go,
what to follow.

335
00:25:27,864 --> 00:25:32,265
(Narrator)
Motivation and incentive exist
when people have meaningful tasks.

336
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:36,095
True growth and development occur
when people are involved in creative

337
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,667
challenging and constructive endeavors.

338
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,865
However, motivation and incentive die
in the daily grind

339
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:46,710
of boring and repetitive jobs
required to earn a paycheck.

340
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:50,593
If you hand out things to people

341
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:53,241
if you fed them, clothed them
and housed them for free

342
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:56,180
they're not going to work in the morning
because they don't need it.

343
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,605
They've got their housing, clothing,
motion pictures and entertainment.

344
00:25:59,745 --> 00:26:04,555
Why go to work? Work is painful,
it's monotonous, it's boring.

345
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:09,527
In the future, if people have access
to all their needs

346
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:13,855
but they don't have any challenges,
this is where it goes to pot.

347
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:17,946
So people constantly
[will be] challenged by new things.

348
00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:22,762
In our schools we challenge them
with many things that are not solved

349
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:25,016
and [there are] many unresolved problems.

350
00:26:25,156 --> 00:26:29,221
If you are well fed and well clothed,
that doesn't stop your brain from working.

351
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:32,577
That would mean
that every millionaire does nothing, it's turned off

352
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:35,073
because you've got all the means.
That's not true.

353
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:37,917
There are many millionaires
that work 18 hours a day

354
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:41,424
and don't have enough time.
It has to do with your background

355
00:26:41,564 --> 00:26:45,826
and your education. The more you know
about oceanography, astronomy, etc.

356
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:48,193
the more interested,
the more alive you are.

357
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:51,601
If you're just given food,
clothing and shelter, now you can go to work.

358
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:53,744
You don't have to worry about
making a living

359
00:26:53,884 --> 00:26:56,776
and your incentive
would be boosted considerably.

360
00:26:56,916 --> 00:27:00,793
I call that a new
and innovative incentive system:

361
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:05,159
it's not monetary oriented,
it's problem-solving oriented.

362
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:09,533
You get your kicks out of seeing the world
become a better place.

363
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:21,318
(Narrator)
How can we use our technology wisely

364
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:25,218
so that there is
more than enough for everyone?

365
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,892
To achieve this, it's mandatory
that the planning for it

366
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:33,895
be based on the carrying capacity
of the planet's resources.

367
00:27:35,692 --> 00:27:38,313
Our entire infrastructure
must be redesigned

368
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:42,075
and operated as coherent,
integrated, total systems.

369
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:46,371
This means we must consider
our entire global community as one unit

370
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:49,745
that includes everyone
and plan accordingly.

371
00:27:49,886 --> 00:27:54,475
Only in this way can we use
our technology to overcome resource shortages

372
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:58,678
provide universal abundance
and protect the environment.

373
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:06,081
Therefore, a global survey is first needed
to assess exactly what we have.

374
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:10,017
This would inventory
our physical resources, personnel

375
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:13,932
production centers
and the needs of people.

376
00:28:14,368 --> 00:28:18,476
This enables us to determine
the amount of goods and services needed.

377
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:22,284
For instance,
where is the arable land to grow crops?

378
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:24,874
How many people are in various locations

379
00:28:25,014 --> 00:28:27,376
and what is the state of their health?

380
00:28:27,516 --> 00:28:31,389
This would determine
where hospitals are built and how many.

381
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,876
If you try to do that today

382
00:28:36,016 --> 00:28:40,399
(ask for a global resource survey of all nations),
they'd wonder

383
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:43,524
&quot;What are you trying to do that for?
To find if we've got enough resources

384
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:45,944
to fight you in armaments
and other things?&quot;

385
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:49,964
They would be skeptical,
hesitant, to give that information.

386
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,638
So I would say it wouldn't work
in today's culture.

387
00:28:53,778 --> 00:28:57,704
But after the ideas are put forth
and the reason for it

388
00:28:57,844 --> 00:29:00,380
and the advantages gained
by all the nations...

389
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,757
It would have to be specific advantages

390
00:29:02,897 --> 00:29:06,150
that they can understand in their terms.

391
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:10,419
If they agree,
then the survey would be conducted.

392
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,596
It's not my opinion
or the opinion of anyone else that would be used.

393
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:18,755
It's the size of the population,
the availability of resources

394
00:29:18,895 --> 00:29:21,760
the carrying capacity of the Earth,
that determines

395
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,858
what is done and how fast things move.

396
00:29:24,998 --> 00:29:28,005
Today it's done on a totally different basis

397
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:31,215
but in the future it will all be based on

398
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,795
a form of dynamic equilibrium.

399
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:38,241
That means operating everything
at the highest potential

400
00:29:38,381 --> 00:29:41,095
without environmental neglect.

401
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:46,914
(Narrator)
The key to achieving abundance
and a high standard of living for all

402
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,225
is to automate as much as possible
in the shortest period of time.

403
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:57,030
But during the transition,
we have to bring together

404
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,317
the technological capabilities of people
working with computers

405
00:30:02,457 --> 00:30:04,482
and working with technology

406
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:10,437
and building and designing methods
of delivering these resources

407
00:30:10,577 --> 00:30:15,294
and the necessary industrial plants
to process the resources.

408
00:30:16,686 --> 00:30:21,048
(Narrator)
Our problems and their solutions
are technical, not political.

409
00:30:21,188 --> 00:30:24,779
Most problems can be solved
when technology and the methods of science

410
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,486
are used to serve all people,
not just a select few.

411
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:32,025
What is it that you want?
You have to ask yourself.

412
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,652
I want to live in a world
where I don't have to fear

413
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:37,879
that my children
will go into another war

414
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:41,781
where there will be deprivation,
problems or disease.

415
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:44,379
&quot;Do you know how to build that kind of world?&quot;
&quot;No I don't!&quot;

416
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,814
How do you go about building?
You call upon the various divisions of science

417
00:30:48,954 --> 00:30:52,484
bring them together and say
&quot;These are the problems we'd like to solve.&quot;

418
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:57,537
A scientific government doesn't mean
that scientists rule or control people.

419
00:30:57,677 --> 00:31:01,910
It means they have better means
for building transportation systems

420
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:05,041
better means for cleaning the air,
they have the best means

421
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:08,649
for restoring the oceans
that we know of to this day.

422
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:14,842
(Narrator)
Computers can serve the needs
of everyone

423
00:31:14,982 --> 00:31:18,020
when cybernation
is ultimately integrated into all aspects

424
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,868
of this new and dynamic culture.

425
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,102
One can think of this
as an electronic nervous system

426
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:28,543
extending into all areas
of the social complex.

427
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,598
Their function would be to coordinate a balance
between production and distribution

428
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:38,052
assuring there are no shortages or overruns.

429
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,174
(Roxanne Meadows)
In this highly technical society

430
00:31:41,314 --> 00:31:44,268
decisions are based on direct environmental

431
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:46,974
human and industrial feedback.

432
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,684
You can think of this
as electrical sensors

433
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,936
throughout the entire environment

434
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,669
from cities, factories, warehouses

435
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:58,189
distribution centers, transportation networks

436
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:02,865
all over the globe gathering data
for more appropriate decisions.

437
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,329
The decisions are based on
the needs of society

438
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:10,121
rather than corporate or private interests.

439
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:15,117
(Narrator)
It is not automated technology
or machines we should be wary of

440
00:32:15,257 --> 00:32:19,761
but the abuse and misuse of technology
by selfish interests.

441
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:24,383
Remember, it is people who decide
what ends the machines will serve.

442
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:27,437
If technology
does not liberate all people

443
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:30,645
for the pursuit of higher aspirations
in human achievement

444
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:34,927
then all its technological potential
will be meaningless.

445
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:38,340
You always do a positive
and negative study

446
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,139
before you engage in the actual reconstruction
of an environment.

447
00:32:51,356 --> 00:32:54,501
(Narrator)
It's all just talk unless
there is a technical plan

448
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:58,520
to organize and use resources
to accomplish abundance.

449
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,341
What follows are some of the many approaches
The Venus Project provides

450
00:33:04,481 --> 00:33:07,111
for the entire social spectrum.

451
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:17,741
Today more than half our population
lives in cities that are polluted

452
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:20,868
dangerous and waste energy.

453
00:33:21,768 --> 00:33:24,737
What we have to do is design a city
as a living system

454
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,981
as an organism, as a university:

455
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:30,656
that all the cities of the future
will be university cities

456
00:33:30,796 --> 00:33:33,514
that grow, that continue to exchange ideas.

457
00:33:33,654 --> 00:33:37,934
The city will have a built-in transportation system
so there are no accidents

458
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:41,082
and no unthought out areas of technology.

459
00:33:41,222 --> 00:33:45,978
Medicine, botany, agriculture, the total system:
one planning system.

460
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:51,690
(Narrator)
It is actually better to build
newer cities from the ground up

461
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,689
than to restore and maintain old ones.

462
00:33:57,055 --> 00:34:00,672
Fresco uses a systems approach
to designing new cities.

463
00:34:00,943 --> 00:34:04,538
They're desirable and pleasant places
to live.

464
00:34:06,526 --> 00:34:11,989
The notion that intelligent overall planning
implies mass uniformity is absurd.

465
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:16,717
Cities would be uniform only to the degree
that they would require far less materials

466
00:34:16,857 --> 00:34:19,036
save time and energy

467
00:34:19,176 --> 00:34:22,303
and be flexible enough
to allow for innovative changes

468
00:34:22,443 --> 00:34:25,226
while preserving the local ecology.

469
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:31,745
If we design our cities to meet human needs

470
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:35,827
you don't have most of the problems
that are prevalent today.

471
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,025
In the central dome you have childcare

472
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:43,739
schools, dental care, medical care.

473
00:34:44,259 --> 00:34:47,177
In the production and design of the cities

474
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:52,579
we work out 1/8th of the city system
and then we reproduce it

475
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,890
instead of having architects
design each building and each structure

476
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,621
which is a tremendous waste
of energy and talent.

477
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:09,047
(Narrator)
When working on solving the housing problem
for all the world's people

478
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:13,659
construction techniques would be vastly different
from those employed today.

479
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:17,803
Extruded and self-erecting structures
could revolutionize

480
00:35:17,943 --> 00:35:20,882
and speed up construction processes.

481
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:25,851
These lightweight, durable apartments
could be produced as continuous extrusions

482
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:30,719
and then separated and positioned in place
by the mega-machines.

483
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:35,294
The outer shells of these efficient structures
serve as photovoltaic generators

484
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:38,181
and heat concentrators.

485
00:35:39,535 --> 00:35:42,080
You don't own anything in this society.

486
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,895
Really, people don't want money;

487
00:35:45,035 --> 00:35:48,337
they want access to things
when they want it.

488
00:35:48,477 --> 00:35:53,391
People in a society of abundance,
having access to things

489
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:58,034
will really no longer begin to store
and accumulate things.

490
00:35:58,174 --> 00:36:01,361
We recycle it,
update it, make it better.

491
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:04,154
Take the same materials
of an old car

492
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:08,178
[they] weigh just as much as a new car,
so there are no old cars.

493
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:10,542
Old cars mean danger.

494
00:36:10,683 --> 00:36:15,502
If you drive a very expensive car
and somebody else drives a beat-up old car

495
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:18,464
if their brakes fail, you may die.

496
00:36:18,604 --> 00:36:20,942
We don't want any old cars on the highway.

497
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:23,266
We don't want anything that breaks down.

498
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:26,410
We don't want anything
that takes looking after.

499
00:36:27,492 --> 00:36:31,802
(Narrator)
In a Resource-Based Economy,
people may access whatever products they need

500
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:36,559
without the burden of having to purchase,
maintain or insure their possessions.

501
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:40,789
In this way, there is much more to go around
for everyone

502
00:36:40,929 --> 00:36:44,101
and products are always available when needed.

503
00:36:44,353 --> 00:36:49,988
Anything people may need
is available in these outside access domes:

504
00:36:51,248 --> 00:36:54,718
sculpturing materials, musical instruments,

505
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:57,541
somewhat like a public library.

506
00:36:57,681 --> 00:37:02,200
They can go down and access a camera,
a bicycle or a wristwatch.

507
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:07,289
Anything they need
is available without a price tag.

508
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:13,112
That would mean we must achieve
a level of production that's so high

509
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:15,719
that scarcity no longer exists.

510
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:19,612
That will prevent almost all crime.

511
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:24,744
There is no way of segmenting
or making this system just or equitable.

512
00:37:24,884 --> 00:37:28,569
We have to make a system
that assures human rights.

513
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:31,439
When everybody has free access
to goods and services

514
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:34,617
you don't have to fight for women's rights,
or black rights.

515
00:37:34,757 --> 00:37:37,495
It's an automatic in a society
that is set up that way.

516
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:42,156
You don't have to make laws [like] 'Don't steal';
it would bypass that behavior.

517
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:48,480
(Jacque Fresco)
Surrounding the central dome,
you have the research centers

518
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,772
centers that do work that's relevant

519
00:37:51,912 --> 00:37:55,361
to the sustainability
of the entire community.

520
00:37:55,662 --> 00:37:58,187
As we move away
from the research centers

521
00:37:58,618 --> 00:38:01,451
we come to the recreational area

522
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:06,165
which has tennis courts
and all of the games that people require.

523
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:15,288
As we move away from that
we come to the residential district.

524
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:20,239
There are streams, waterfalls,
lakes throughout the area.

525
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,323
(Narrator)
We could provide a wide range
of unique homes and apartments

526
00:38:30,463 --> 00:38:34,211
that can be relatively maintenance free,
fireproof

527
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:37,711
and virtually impervious
to adverse weather conditions.

528
00:38:43,412 --> 00:38:47,069
As we move to the next sector,
we come to apartments.

529
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:50,298
The reason some people
want to live in apartments

530
00:38:50,438 --> 00:38:54,309
is because you have drama groups,
you have gymnasiums

531
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:59,244
medical care, dental care;
everything is built-in to the central towers.

532
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:04,234
I feel that in the future,
people will move away from individual houses

533
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,684
and live in larger complexes.

534
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:13,152
As we move outward
we come to the indoor agriculture

535
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:15,264
or hydroponic farms.

536
00:39:15,404 --> 00:39:18,702
Then there is also outdoor agriculture.

537
00:39:21,995 --> 00:39:24,622
(Narrator)
The city would use the best
of clean technology

538
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:29,828
in harmony with nature,
such as wind, solar, geothermal

539
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:35,368
heat concentrators, piezoelectric,
wave, temperature differentials

540
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,932
ocean thermal vents and much more.

541
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,448
A major development for generating energy
in the future

542
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:46,876
could be the construction of a land bridge
or tunnel across the Bering Strait.

543
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:53,888
These underwater structures
convert a portion of the ocean currents

544
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:57,640
through turbines to generate
clean sources of power.

545
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:02,034
By using these sources of energy
we could power the earth on clean energy

546
00:40:02,174 --> 00:40:05,554
and enable all people to enjoy
a very high standard of living

547
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,779
for thousands of years to come.

548
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:12,837
There is no need for the use
of polluting hydrocarbons any longer.

549
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:16,068
Pollution will be a thing of the past.

550
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:22,663
All transportation will be integrated
into a worldwide transportation system.

551
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:27,424
Transportation within cities
will be by transveyors.

552
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:34,569
City-to-city travel
will be by monorail.

553
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:43,813
Maglev trains are utilized
for long distance travel.

554
00:40:44,929 --> 00:40:47,806
To enhance efficiency,
this high-speed maglev train

555
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,065
is equipped with removable sections

556
00:40:50,205 --> 00:40:53,052
which can be disengaged
while the train is in motion.

557
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,861
Aircraft will display
a wide range of configurations.

558
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,647
These VTOL aircraft
(or Vertical Takeoff and Landing)

559
00:41:03,787 --> 00:41:06,716
are used to transport passengers
and freight.

560
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:10,113
The priority is safety
rather than saving money

561
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:12,394
or dealing with the lowest bidder.

562
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:17,161
This modular freighter
consists of detachable sections

563
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:20,170
that can be rapidly loaded
or unloaded.

564
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:25,532
The number of sections varies depending
on the amount of freight to be delivered.

565
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:30,121
When all the sections are connected
they can be propelled as a single unit.

566
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,549
Ships can be floating manufacturing plants

567
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,285
that produce products
while en route to their destinations.

568
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,457
They can also serve
as education centers

569
00:41:40,597 --> 00:41:45,291
where children and adults travel worldwide
obtaining innovative education

570
00:41:45,431 --> 00:41:48,585
not through vicarious study,
but through experiencing

571
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:52,286
and interacting with
the 'real-world' environment.

572
00:41:54,547 --> 00:41:58,157
A national transportation system
would include a network of waterways

573
00:41:58,297 --> 00:42:01,180
canals
and irrigation systems.

574
00:42:03,017 --> 00:42:05,863
They could serve to minimize the threat
of floods and droughts

575
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:10,129
while allowing for the migration of fish,
provide natural firebreaks

576
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:14,705
emergency water sources,
fish farms and recreation areas.

577
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:19,314
When we unleash
science and technology

578
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,712
directly into the social system

579
00:42:21,852 --> 00:42:26,616
without the restrictions of the market place,
finances or patents

580
00:42:26,756 --> 00:42:29,402
we could achieve
a very high standard of living

581
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:32,281
within a very short period of time.

582
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:35,438
This society would continuously improve

583
00:42:35,578 --> 00:42:40,488
changing rapidly through new technologies,
inventions and ideas.

584
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,084
It would be an emergent society

585
00:42:43,224 --> 00:42:46,462
rather than an established one
like we have today.

586
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:53,769
(Narrator)
Imagine living in
an extraordinary oceanic city

587
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:56,054
helping to restore
the ocean environment

588
00:42:56,194 --> 00:42:59,264
while eliminating
land-based population pressures.

589
00:43:04,653 --> 00:43:08,866
These cities in the sea may serve
as universities and research centers

590
00:43:09,006 --> 00:43:11,683
where students study marine sciences.

591
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:18,689
They could be used for ocean farming,
mariculture and mining

592
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,997
while maintaining a dynamic balance
in the oceanographic environment.

593
00:43:24,892 --> 00:43:27,935
Self-sufficient cities in the sea
vary in design

594
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:31,455
depending on their location and function.

595
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:35,983
This undersea observation station
permits people

596
00:43:36,123 --> 00:43:38,940
to view marine life
in its natural habitat.

597
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:43,701
These mariculture and sea-farming systems

598
00:43:43,841 --> 00:43:47,461
cultivate and raise fish
along with other forms of marine life

599
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:50,978
to help meet the nutritional needs
of the world's people.

600
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:56,222
These structures would permit
the free flow of water throughout.

601
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:03,252
Using technology in this way
would make it possible for a global society

602
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:07,730
to achieve social advancement
and worldwide reconstruction

603
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:10,471
in the shortest time possible.

604
00:44:10,995 --> 00:44:16,149
Utopia, if it's ever established,
will die, will stagnate.

605
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:20,337
Whereas what I'm talking about
is an evolving culture

606
00:44:20,642 --> 00:44:22,551
or an emergent culture.

607
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:26,517
I have no notions of a perfect society.
I don't know what that means.

608
00:44:26,657 --> 00:44:29,548
I know we can do much better
than what we've got.

609
00:44:29,688 --> 00:44:32,690
I'm no Utopian.
I'm not... a humanist

610
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,881
that would like to see everybody
living in warmth and harmony.

611
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:40,623
[But] I know that if we don't live that way,
we'll kill each other and destroy the Earth.

612
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,908
(Narrator)
This new lifestyle,
while providing leisure and recreation

613
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:48,542
would also enhance knowledge and creativity
for everyone.

614
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:53,265
The measure of success
would be the fulfillment of one's personal interests

615
00:44:53,405 --> 00:44:57,859
rather than the acquisition of wealth
and self-centered goals.

616
00:44:59,827 --> 00:45:03,027
A Resource-Based Economy
would not only change our environment

617
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,058
to make it clean,
efficient and enjoyable

618
00:45:06,565 --> 00:45:08,749
but it would introduce
a new value system

619
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:13,008
appropriate to the direction
and aims of the new innovative approach.

620
00:45:13,955 --> 00:45:16,299
With education and resources made available

621
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,544
there would be no limit
to the human potential.

622
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:21,790
Everyone will have the freedom to pursue

623
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:25,339
whatever constructive field of endeavor
he or she chooses

624
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,907
without the economic limitations
that we face today.

625
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:36,789
We are now at a time when decisions
must be made

626
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:40,843
if we wish to evolve
from our present culture of scarcity

627
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:44,719
waste and environmental destruction

628
00:45:45,947 --> 00:45:51,111
to a sustainable society
of ecological concern and abundance.

629
00:45:51,926 --> 00:45:55,250
A nation without a vision
of what the future can be

630
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:57,487
is bound to repeat past errors

631
00:45:57,906 --> 00:46:01,851
over
and over again.

632
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:07,066
We say dishonestly

633
00:46:07,206 --> 00:46:11,047
that man is the highest form of evolution
which [is what] you get in schools.

634
00:46:11,187 --> 00:46:16,586
Man destroys the oceans, the fish,
the atmosphere and one another.

635
00:46:16,881 --> 00:46:20,011
Man flies over a city,
presses a button

636
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:23,009
and burns everybody in the city
with nuclear weapons.

637
00:46:23,149 --> 00:46:26,252
Is he the highest creation of nature?
Not yet!

638
00:46:26,718 --> 00:46:29,843
in my opinion.
We've got a long way to go.

639
00:46:29,983 --> 00:46:33,693
We could either develop
paradise on Earth or oblivion;

640
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:37,465
wipe ourselves out,
only the future will tell.

641
00:46:37,605 --> 00:46:40,771
It's what you do to make the future.

642
00:46:43,242 --> 00:46:48,375
(Narrator)
We can create a world where war and want
are distant memories.

643
00:46:49,131 --> 00:46:52,458
When all of science and technology
are used

644
00:46:52,598 --> 00:46:55,566
within a global resource-based economy

645
00:46:55,706 --> 00:46:59,536
for the protection of the environment
and the well-being of all

646
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:03,273
only then will we understand

647
00:47:03,413 --> 00:47:07,669
what it means to be truly civilized.

648
00:47:16,444 --> 00:47:18,570
Be a part of the growing community
of people

649
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:22,826
working toward making the aims
of The Venus Project a reality.

650
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:26,306
Join us in our efforts
to bring this vision of a positive future

651
00:47:26,446 --> 00:47:30,757
to a wider audience
through the goal of a major motion picture.

652
00:47:31,903 --> 00:47:35,051
All of these things
can be built with what we know today.

653
00:47:35,192 --> 00:47:38,111
It would take 10 years
to change the surface of the Earth

654
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:40,906
to rebuild the world
into a second Garden of Eden.

655
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:44,872
The choice lies with you.
The stupidity of a nuclear arms race

656
00:47:45,012 --> 00:47:48,685
the development of weapons,
trying to solve your problems politically

657
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:51,810
by electing this political party
or that political party...

658
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:54,504
ALL politics are immersed in corruption.

659
00:47:54,644 --> 00:47:57,475
Let me say it again: Communism, Socialism

660
00:47:57,616 --> 00:47:59,980
Fascism, the Democrats, the Liberals.

661
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,529
There are no Negro problems,
Polish problems or Jewish problems

662
00:48:04,669 --> 00:48:08,058
or Greek problems or women's problems.
They're human problems!
