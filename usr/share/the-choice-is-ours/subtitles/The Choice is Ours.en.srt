1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,372
[Larry King, host] Alright, let's explore
the thinking of Jacque Fresco

2
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:05,973
and the society that he'd like to see.

3
00:00:06,50 --> 00:00:08,878
(Jacque Fresco) The reason
we emphasize machines and technology

4
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:11,758
is to free man
to pursue the higher things.

5
00:00:12,964 --> 00:00:17,416
Machines ought to do the filthy,
repetitious, or the boring jobs.

6
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:21,180
It would take ten years
to change the surface of the Earth.

7
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:25,452
To save our environment,
[considering] our stupidity, our conflict,

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:30,522
we've got to reorganize our way of thinking
and reconsider our social aims.

9
00:00:31,94 --> 00:00:36,400
We must put our mind to this
as we do to put a man on the moon.

10
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:42,987
[Jeff Hoffman, retired NASA astronaut]
Like many kids, when I was 6 years old

11
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:46,649
I dreamed of flying in space.
I'm old enough that,

12
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:50,750
back then, the only astronauts were
Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers.

13
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:56,944
I went on and became a professional astronomer.

14
00:00:57,84 --> 00:01:01,599
I was lucky enough to get selected
in the first group of shuttle astronauts.

15
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:04,922
We trained for a long time.

16
00:01:04,962 --> 00:01:08,373
Of course, you go through
many different types of simulators.

17
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:11,629
But when you're actually
sitting up there on the rocket,

18
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:15,786
you realize that "Hey, this is not the simulator!"

19
00:01:22,37 --> 00:01:25,170
The whole vehicle is
shaking a little bit on the pad.

20
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,770
Then, you hear this roar down beneath you.

21
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,683
The whole shuttle tilts forward a little bit.

22
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:37,50
Then, as it comes back to the vertical position,

23
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,190
all of a sudden,
Wham! The solid boosters ignite.

24
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,124
There's an incredible vibration and noise.

25
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,403
For the next two minutes,
there is just so much power

26
00:01:46,543 --> 00:01:48,850
that you're sitting on top of.

27
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:59,81
I was just holding on, thinking to myself

28
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:01,513
"Whoa! I hope this whole thing holds together."

29
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,653
Sure enough, it did.

30
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:07,252
By that time, we're looking out the window.

31
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:11,267
The blue sky has already
turned to the blackness of space.

32
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:15,958
And I can see in the distance
the coast of Africa coming up into view.

33
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:20,500
I always remember that feeling
on my first flight when I realized:

34
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:23,737
Wow, you're in space!

35
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:32,914
You see from orbit the sunrises and sunsets

36
00:02:33,54 --> 00:02:36,332
16 times every 24 hours.

37
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:42,38
Flying over the Earth at night, in particular

38
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:45,405
gives you a real sense of human civilization.

39
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:51,960
During the day, you look down
and you see the colors of the Earth.

40
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,146
You see the forms of the landmass,
of the continents.

41
00:02:58,543 --> 00:03:01,608
There's a lot of beautiful things
to see during the day.

42
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:06,593
There's also the view of the impact

43
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:11,621
that humans have had on our planet,
and that can be pretty scary.

44
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:14,267
Over the course of 11 years of flying

45
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:20,380
I watched as the Amazon jungle
was continually being deforested.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,591
[RondÃ´nia, Brazil 2010
24 years of deforestation]

47
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:25,974
At night, you'd constantly see agricultural burning

48
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:28,340
all over the world.

49
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,670
You could see harbors being silted up.

50
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,310
You could see, in Africa,
how the tree line would go up every year.

51
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:46,91
We know about global warming
and what we're doing to the atmosphere.

52
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:49,480
That's the other thing
you really get a sense of from space

53
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,648
is how thin our atmosphere is.

54
00:03:56,851 --> 00:04:02,181
Basically, the idea that
we're seeing this environmental damage

55
00:04:03,29 --> 00:04:06,94
on the Earth, created by humans,

56
00:04:07,227 --> 00:04:09,912
but we see it from a cosmic perspective,

57
00:04:10,52 --> 00:04:12,630
means that it's just
not something that we can ignore.

58
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:18,65
The planet is responding
to the presence of humanity.

59
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:33,876
[Carl Sagan, "Pale Blue Dot", 1994]
The Earth is a very small stage

60
00:04:34,16 --> 00:04:38,703
in a vast cosmic arena.

61
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:44,277
Think of the rivers of blood

62
00:04:44,712 --> 00:04:48,90
spilled by all those generals and emperors

63
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:53,238
so that in glory and triumph

64
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:56,247
they can become the momentary masters

65
00:04:56,387 --> 00:05:00,463
of a fraction of a dot.
[Earth from 3.7 billion miles]

66
00:05:00,603 --> 00:05:03,304
Think of the endless cruelties visited

67
00:05:04,75 --> 00:05:07,139
by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel

68
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,827
on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants
of some other corner.

69
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,765
How eager they are to kill one another,

70
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:18,364
how fervent their hatreds.

71
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:20,925
Our posturings,

72
00:05:21,65 --> 00:05:24,279
our imagined self-importance,

73
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:30,536
the delusion that we have
some privileged position in the universe

74
00:05:32,95 --> 00:05:36,532
are challenged by this point of pale light.

75
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:41,272
Our planet is a lonely speck

76
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:44,867
in the great enveloping cosmic dark.

77
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:48,294
In all this vastness, there is no hint

78
00:05:48,434 --> 00:05:50,975
that help will come from elsewhere

79
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,991
to save us

80
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:55,206
from ourselves.

Documentary film by Roxanne Meadows, Joel Holt
Original score by Kat Epple

84
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:18,724
PART I

85
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:23,111
(Narrator) For the first time,
we have the capability, the technology,

86
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:29,382
and the knowledge to achieve
a global society of abundance for all.

87
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:32,234
We cannot continue as we are

88
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:35,586
or the consequences will surely be dire.

89
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:42,379
A 2012 UN report states that
a global population growth

90
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:47,555
from 7 billion to almost 9 billion
is expected by 2040.

91
00:06:48,55 --> 00:06:51,276
Demands for resources will rise exponentially.

92
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:56,443
By 2030, requirements for food
are projected to rise by 50%,

93
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,842
energy by 45%,

94
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,47
and water by 30%.

95
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:04,16
We are presently depleting natural resources

96
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:07,833
50% faster than the planet can renew.

97
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:12,50
At this rate, it is estimated that
we'll need 3 more planet Earths

98
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,270
to keep up with resource needs as they are today.

99
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:18,24
What is the sixth extinction?

100
00:07:18,64 --> 00:07:20,705
Is it happening right now? What's the cause of it?

101
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:24,135
What we, as human beings, are doing to the planet

102
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:27,30
is changing the basic conditions of life

103
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,777
very dramatically and very rapidly.

104
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:34,231
(Narrator) And yet,
from environmental disaster to war,

105
00:07:34,761 --> 00:07:38,626
our obsolete value systems perpetuate insanity,

106
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,190
threatening us on many fronts.

107
00:07:42,992 --> 00:07:48,443
Is it the best we can do
to just clean up after the fact?

108
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:54,645
Are politicians capable or even competent
to manage the world around us?

109
00:07:55,484 --> 00:07:57,721
(Gordon Brown) Let me explain.

110
00:07:58,81 --> 00:08:00,793
Order! The prime minister.

111
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:04,214
(Narrator) Are we simply incapable of anticipating

112
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:06,732
and planning for our future?

113
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:11,162
Are we innately flawed in ways we can't change?

114
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:13,492
(Journalist) Why not just use firing squads?
- Aim!

115
00:08:14,52 --> 00:08:17,169
(Narrator) We often hear
that human nature is fixed...

116
00:08:18,27 --> 00:08:19,693
It's only human nature!

117
00:08:20,35 --> 00:08:22,606
...and our worst qualities are inborn.

118
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:25,121
- How are they gonna stop being criminals?
- Oh, nonsense!

119
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:28,494
They were born that way and
there is no use trying to change them.

120
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:33,260
THE DETERMINANTS OF BEHAVIOR

121
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:36,495
[Henry Schlinger Jr., PhD] I think it's
difficult to talk about a specific human nature

122
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:40,550
like we talk about fixed or modal
action patterns in nonhuman species.

123
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,47
But clearly in humans,
learning plays the major role.

124
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:45,771
In fact, I refer to humans
as 'the learning animal',

125
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:49,165
because humans learn more than any other animal.

126
00:08:50,343 --> 00:08:54,654
(Narrator) And yet,
considering our history of aggression,

127
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:56,992
warlike tendencies,

128
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:59,465
jealousies and hatred...

129
00:08:59,808 --> 00:09:01,64
(US soldier) Keep shootin'

130
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:04,692
(Narrator) ...we still have much to learn.

131
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:08,604
One would think it impossible to simply overlook

132
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:11,217
the conditions we're immersed in.

133
00:09:13,35 --> 00:09:15,96
(Jacque) The culture doesn't know any better.

134
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:19,431
They don't know what forces
are involved in shaping human behavior.

135
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:22,866
Therefore, they invent their own concept

136
00:09:23,6 --> 00:09:26,957
and project their own values into human behavior

137
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:29,198
and say that's human nature.

138
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:31,348
That's where they're wrong.

139
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:35,627
(Henry) Right now we have an explosion
of technologies in our culture.

140
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:39,295
I think many people think that
technology is going to save us.

141
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:42,469
Certainly technology has made our lives
easier in many respects.

142
00:09:42,602 --> 00:09:44,737
- Find parking space.
- Parking space found.

143
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,179
Sometimes it's good; sometimes it's not so good.

144
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,445
(Journalist) Drones armed with Hellfire missiles...

145
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:53,19
How would you like to get paid
to spy on your neighbors?

146
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:56,297
There's one technology that we don't have,
that we sorely need

147
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:59,610
if we're going to really change,
and that's the technology of behavior.

148
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,498
The science of behavior needs to be
applied like the sciences of physics,

149
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:06,114
chemistry, and biology have been.

150
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:11,656
That's that one missing ingredient in our culture.

151
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,145
And that's the toughest one because

152
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:18,252
it opposes the way that
most people think about themselves.

153
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:23,83
(Narrator) Examining human behavior
in the same manner

154
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,389
as any other physical phenomenon

155
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:29,441
will enable us to understand
the factors responsible for shaping

156
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:32,478
our attitudes and our conduct.

157
00:10:33,16 --> 00:10:35,632
(Henry) All natural scientists
assume that their subject matters

158
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:39,587
are lawful and orderly.
If they're not, then you can't do science.

159
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:42,252
Behavioral scientists assume
that human behavior and

160
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:45,477
the behavior of other organisms
is also lawful and orderly.

161
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,291
To not assume that means that you accept that

162
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:52,520
human behavior is somehow separate
from the rest of nature.

163
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,588
We don't make that assumption.
We make the assumption

164
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:56,588
that human behavior is part of nature.

165
00:10:56,728 --> 00:11:00,108
(Narrator) Human behavior
is just as lawful as everything else.

166
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:03,898
(Jacque) The sunflower
does not turn to the sun.

167
00:11:04,38 --> 00:11:06,103
The sun makes it turn

168
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:08,322
by pulling in membranes.

169
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:11,882
A sailboat cannot sail.
The wind moves it.

170
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:15,850
Plants can't grow.
They are shoved

171
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:20,304
by sunshine, soil, temperature,
all kinds of things.

172
00:11:21,89 --> 00:11:23,891
All things are shoved by something else.

173
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:28,20
All people are acted upon by other things.

174
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:32,647
Remember, your mother said "cup, table, light

175
00:11:33,21 --> 00:11:37,170
papa, mama" over and over again
until you did the same thing.

176
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:40,900
Even race hatred is learned.

177
00:11:41,40 --> 00:11:44,586
(Announcer) ... as the ideals
of intolerance and racial superiority

178
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:47,181
are taught to succeeding generations.

179
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:49,856
You could be brought up to hate Afro-Americans.

180
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:53,841
You could be brought up to hate
Jews, Swedes, all kinds of people.

181
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:56,223
- I hate Philippinos,

182
00:11:57,2 --> 00:11:58,599
I hate Mexicans,

183
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:00,656
I hate them all!

184
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:03,913
We could raise a Jewish boy
in a Nazi culture.

185
00:12:04,53 --> 00:12:05,553
He becomes a good Nazi.

186
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:07,213
A PRIME EFFECTOR ?

187
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:11,597
(Narrator) Mechanical processes are
based upon many interacting systems.

188
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:15,62
- What you got there, son?
- A plane.

189
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,222
What makes it fly? Is it the propeller?

190
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,933
- The propeller is not going to turn
unless you have the motor, right?

191
00:12:21,73 --> 00:12:24,821
- So, it's the motor?
- But the motor needs fuel.

192
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,151
- So I'm guessing it's the fuel that makes it fly.

193
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:31,620
- Almost, but if you don't have the spark plugs,

194
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,400
and the oxygen, the fuel's not going to burn.

195
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,779
- So it's spark plugs and oxygen?

196
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,829
- You would think so,
but actually, even with all that working,

197
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:44,980
if you don't have the wings
and control surfaces to give it lift

198
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,140
it will never get off the ground.

199
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,148
- So it's the wings
and control surfaces that make it fly?

200
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:54,884
- Actually, it's all the above, son.
It's a complicated machine.

201
00:12:55,24 --> 00:12:58,842
It needs all these things working together
to make the plane fly.

202
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:02,305
That's a lot like other technologies
and even human behavior.

203
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:06,622
- So it's all those things that make it fly.
- Exactly, kiddo!

204
00:13:09,63 --> 00:13:11,968
(Narrator) Just like mechanical systems,
our behavior

205
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:14,11
has no single cause.

206
00:13:14,35 --> 00:13:19,222
- God gives people good blood and bad blood,
and there's an end to it.

207
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:23,646
(Narrator) Our behavior is generated
by the many interacting variables

208
00:13:23,786 --> 00:13:25,805
that we encounter.

209
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,882
(Henry) The environment can
never be the same for any two individuals.

210
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:35,959
That really counters claims
that people make when they say

211
00:13:36,60 --> 00:13:38,406
"I have three children. They were all raised

212
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:41,177
in the same environment, but they all turned out so different."

213
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:43,575
Well, by that definition, the same environment

214
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:46,411
refers to the house they lived in
or the parents they had.

215
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,696
(Jacque) There's no such thing as
'the same environment'.

216
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:54,265
If you have two kids, one is 4 years old
and you play with him,

217
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:58,550
and the 7 year old is standing there
with that lower lip sticking out.

218
00:13:59,45 --> 00:14:02,113
You say "What's the matter?"
and the kid goes like that.

219
00:14:03,154 --> 00:14:06,736
You're making jealousy and envy.
That's where it comes from.

220
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,716
(Henry) But from a scientific perspective,
the environment really consists

221
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,751
of the moment to moment interactions
between your behavior

222
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:15,880
and those events both inside and outside you.

223
00:14:16,20 --> 00:14:18,443
So, the environment is in constant flux.

224
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:21,587
(Jacque) You put the young kid
on your lap and the older kid.

225
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,379
You say "I love you both."

226
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,214
You never play with any one kid
or have a favorite.

227
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:28,814
If you say "You can go to the movie

228
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:30,983
but you can't because
you didn't do your homework",

229
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:34,684
when she falls down the stairs,
you have a grin on your face.

230
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:38,574
It's not that you're bad,
but you feel you've been mistreated.

231
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:42,264
(Narrator) Even our concepts of
aesthetics and beauty

232
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:45,733
are often attributed to an intrinsic quality,

233
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:49,146
but closer investigation
reveals that these perceptions

234
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:52,897
vary greatly from place to place
and throughout history.

235
00:14:53,38 --> 00:14:56,704
(Henry) I think notions of aesthetics
and beauty are for the most part learned.

236
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:59,671
All you have to do are cross-cultural examinations

237
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:02,445
of what people consider
to be attractive and beautiful.

238
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:05,781
You'll find that they differ widely
from culture to culture.

239
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:08,214
Sometimes they differ widely
within the same culture.

240
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:11,342
(Jacque) There are people who wear
brass rings around their neck.

241
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:12,948
They stretch their neck.

242
00:15:13,88 --> 00:15:15,876
If you take those rings away,
the head would fall over

243
00:15:16,16 --> 00:15:17,578
and they call that beauty.

244
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,889
On some of the islands I went to visit,

245
00:15:20,29 --> 00:15:23,986
if the girl had a buttocks
that stuck way out, that was beautiful.

246
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:25,954
The other girls were nothing.

247
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:28,768
(Announcer) Even a girl
might find herself shut up in a cage

248
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:32,207
until she's put on almost 265 pounds
that make her almost,

249
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:35,318
but not quite eligible for marriage in her country.

250
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:38,252
(Henry) I know there are suggestions
that there are genetic contributions

251
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:40,666
to what we think is beautiful,

252
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:44,605
but I think the most parsimonious
explanation we can have for

253
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:48,698
what constitutes beauty
to a given individual has to come

254
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:51,541
from that individual's environment;
the culture they're raised in.

255
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:56,124
(Jacque) If everybody had a nose a foot long,
you'd have surgery done.

256
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,976
There is no such thing as beauty.

257
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:02,439
It's all projection.

258
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:06,463
If you marry the most beautiful girl in the world

259
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:08,968
and she turns out to be a pain in the butt,

260
00:16:09,108 --> 00:16:11,492
that face becomes ugly to you.

261
00:16:12,677 --> 00:16:15,402
(Narrator) Some researchers are posing that genes

262
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:19,8
rather than upbringing,
determine if someone might become a criminal

263
00:16:19,148 --> 00:16:20,951
and even a murderer.

264
00:16:21,453 --> 00:16:24,438
(Henry) If you ask people to tell you
what determines whether they become

265
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:26,593
a doctor, or a lawyer, or whatever profession,

266
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:29,171
most people will agree that
it has to do with your upbringing:

267
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:32,417
the influences from your parents,
from teachers, from others.

268
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:36,91
Not genes. Genes don't determine
that you become a lawyer or a doctor.

269
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:38,761
(Narrator) Genes don't give us a value system

270
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:42,24
or a process level by which we operate.

271
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:44,726
(Henry) Genes don't shape
our behavior. The genes themselves

272
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:46,965
were shaped by our evolutionary history.

273
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:50,14
But our behavior alone is squarely shaped

274
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:52,824
by the environment that we're exposed to.

275
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:55,891
(Narrator) Behavior does not occur in a vacuum.

276
00:16:56,31 --> 00:16:59,973
It is always dependent on
considerable environmental input.

277
00:17:00,113 --> 00:17:04,503
(Jacque) I wanted to know whether men have
a natural attitude toward women,

278
00:17:04,643 --> 00:17:06,826
or do they learn it?

279
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:10,202
So I went to some island years ago.

280
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:15,566
The interesting thing about the islanders
is that they wore no clothing.

281
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:19,984
I never saw a male stare at the female body.

282
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:22,617
Children swim nude when they're babies.

283
00:17:22,757 --> 00:17:24,513
Boys and girls together.

284
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:27,664
There were no Peeping Toms on the island.

285
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:32,313
There were no pictures of nude women
up on the wall in their huts

286
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,662
because it was a normal thing to be nude.

287
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:37,772
They said to the girl "Me like you."

288
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:40,920
They stroked them from the top of the head,
all the way down.

289
00:17:41,60 --> 00:17:43,113
They didn't go for the breasts.

290
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:46,251
Men go for women's breasts in this country

291
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:49,111
because they're taught
"Hey, get a load of that chick!"

292
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:51,644
THE BLAME GAME

293
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,57
- And whose fault is it?

294
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,487
- It's not the Democrats' fault.

295
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,574
- And it's all Obama's fault!

296
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,472
(Henry) The traditional notion,
which is one that gives the

297
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:05,630
individual personal responsibility and autonomy

298
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:08,604
is one that gives the individual
credit for his or her behavior

299
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:12,89
and also, on the other hand,
blames the individual for his or her behavior.

300
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,762
(Jacque) Blaming people for their behavior

301
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:17,226
is one of the most detrimental things

302
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:20,311
of our so-called advanced culture.

303
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:23,732
Their behavior is shaped
by the culture they are brought up in.

304
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:27,695
(Henry) That's built upon,
or based upon, an assumption

305
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:30,433
that we are free; we freely choose our behavior.

306
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:34,547
But a scientific perspective
actually takes the opposite viewpoint.

307
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:37,988
The scientific perspective is a determinist one,
which suggests

308
00:18:38,61 --> 00:18:41,821
that our behavior is lawful and orderly,
our behavior is caused.

309
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,465
(Jacque) There's no serial killer
that doesn't have a background

310
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:46,22
that made him that way.

311
00:18:46,22 --> 00:18:48,663
Every New York gangster

312
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:52,719
is made that way, by associating with people like that.

313
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:57,609
(Narrator) Our social and legal systems
blame and punish the individual.

314
00:18:57,612 --> 00:19:01,436
Yet these attempts to
modify conduct by punitive means

315
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:04,397
ignores the person's background and surroundings

316
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:06,620
which shape that behavior to begin with.

317
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:09,592
(TV announcer) From old school prison gangs

318
00:19:09,592 --> 00:19:11,693
to disruptive street gangs:

319
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,180
it's a dangerous mix for staff and inmates alike.

320
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:18,343
(Narrator) Research shows that learning

321
00:19:18,543 --> 00:19:22,844
also changes the physical
and chemical structure of the brain.

322
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:25,784
Obviously, there are many contributing factors,

323
00:19:25,978 --> 00:19:30,529
but genes play a small role
in comparison to the effects

324
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:33,875
of the overall environment on how we learn.

325
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,440
(Jacque) No Chinese baby was ever born speaking Chinese.

326
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,953
Did you know that?
They had to go to school to learn the language.

327
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:46,561
No French baby was ever born speaking French.

328
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,570
No matter how many years the parents spoke French

329
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,171
they have to learn it.

330
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:56,217
(Henry) Our cerebral cortex
is really built on plasticity.

331
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:59,627
Our behavior is very malleable and very adaptive.

332
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,484
We're the most adaptive creature on the planet.

333
00:20:02,624 --> 00:20:04,694
If you look at the history of
humankind on the planet

334
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:06,704
you can see that we've learned to adapt to

335
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:08,804
every single environment on the planet.

336
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:12,363
(Jacque) The only difference
between a preacher and a thief

337
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,772
is the environment they're reared in.

338
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,850
(Narrator) We don't come to our own conclusions

339
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,532
without any outside influences.

340
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:27,328
We don't change our minds.

341
00:20:27,468 --> 00:20:30,514
Our minds are changed by events.

342
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:35,569
- Heard about them Wright brothers?

343
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:36,834
- No.

344
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:40,774
- They say they wanna build themselves a flying machine.

345
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:44,269
- They ain't never gonna be no flying machine.

346
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:47,892
If God wanted them to fly,
he would give them wings.

347
00:20:48,216 --> 00:20:51,411
(Roaring laughter)

348
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:55,879
(Narrator) Our minds are changed by events.

349
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,961
- I changed my mind!

350
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:00,146
- Yeah, me too.

351
00:21:02,23 --> 00:21:05,234
(Jacque) If you're born with a brain that's more effective,

352
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:07,620
faster than the average brain,

353
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,777
you become a fascist faster

354
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:12,997
if you're brought up in a fascist environment.

355
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:17,833
A good brain cannot describe
that which is significant.

356
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:21,171
The brain has no mechanism of discrimination;

357
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:25,65
only experimental evidence determines that.

358
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:30,292
(Narrator) If the surroundings that
establish our values remain unaltered,

359
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:34,785
in spite of the urgings of poets,
priests, and politicians

360
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,660
the same behavior and values will persist.

361
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,199
(Jacque) If you tell people that
you're not to fish in a certain area,

362
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,458
if you don't provide food for those people

363
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:49,360
and the means of living,
they will violate those laws.

364
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:54,246
All laws have to coincide
with the nature of the physical world.

365
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:57,242
But it isn't the law that prevents crime,

366
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,563
it's if you meet the conditions.

367
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:02,956
(Journalist) These days,
rhino poachers come by helicopter

368
00:22:03,96 --> 00:22:06,963
armed with powerful tranquilizers,
and a chainsaw.

369
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:11,59
Rhino horn is now worth more than gold.

370
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,994
(Jacque) If people are unemployed,

371
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:17,162
they will do whatever they have to do
to feed their family.

372
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:21,348
If you make a law and say that
you're not to steal food,

373
00:22:21,488 --> 00:22:25,406
they will steal food,
if that serves their family needs.

374
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:28,876
Any law that's made by man that doesn't fit

375
00:22:29,16 --> 00:22:33,575
the circumstances of reality will be violated.

376
00:22:34,658 --> 00:22:38,430
(Narrator) Higher ideals and aspirations
that people hope for

377
00:22:38,571 --> 00:22:42,625
can't be realized
when there is deprivation and war.

378
00:22:44,87 --> 00:22:48,28
[Andrew Bacevich - Boston University]
If you want to go bomb somebody

379
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:51,562
there's remarkably little discussion
about how much it might cost.

380
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,663
But when you have a discussion about whether or not

381
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:56,4
we can assist people who are suffering,

382
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:59,154
then suddenly we become very cost-conscious.

383
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:03,72
(Narrator) No culture
evaluates human behavior in this way.

384
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:08,29
If they did, they would question
what is it that generates greed,

385
00:23:08,157 --> 00:23:12,435
bigotry, inequities, and war.

386
00:23:12,831 --> 00:23:16,501
(Jacque) They bring you up with
the values that put them in power.

387
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:21,516
(Narrator) Unfortunately, all societies to date

388
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:26,722
have indoctrinated people toward values
that perpetuate those in power.

389
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:31,442
PART II

390
00:23:31,623 --> 00:23:34,413
(Narrator) So, let's investigate the key factors

391
00:23:34,553 --> 00:23:38,581
governing the lives of people and nations:

392
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,96
Money, and the values,

393
00:23:41,96 --> 00:23:44,198
behaviors, and consequences it produces.

394
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:46,237
- Time and sales data

395
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:47,872
- Split-second staff

396
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:50,653
"It was difficult for early forms of life

397
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:53,29
to crawl out of the primordial slime

398
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:55,808
without dragging some of it with them."
~Jacque Fresco

399
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:58,353
(Narrator) As a remnant of Antiquity,

400
00:23:58,955 --> 00:24:02,983
money now largely serves
as a mechanism of corruption,

401
00:24:03,617 --> 00:24:07,171
deprivation, and control in the hands of a few.

402
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:09,894
[Abby Martin, Journalist & Host]
It has corrupted everything.

403
00:24:10,34 --> 00:24:12,626
Every institution that we live in
is corrupted by money.

404
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:15,106
What's fascinating to me is that

405
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:18,954
we can become enslaved by
something that we've created,

406
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,550
not physically, but just mentally enslaved

407
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,524
by a notion that was invented by humanity.

408
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:30,479
It is archaic, because I think
we've grown past what money can do.

409
00:24:31,632 --> 00:24:34,158
"It is well enough that the people of the nation

410
00:24:34,202 --> 00:24:37,440
do not understand our banking
and money system, for if they did,

411
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,529
I believe there would be
a revolution before tomorrow morning."

412
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:44,513
~Henry Ford, Ford Motor Company

413
00:24:45,74 --> 00:24:49,844
(Narrator) In a desperate attempt to survive,
many work multiple jobs.

414
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:55,482
They may steal, lie, or embezzle.

415
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:58,608
(Jacque) So stress producing to the average person.

416
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:02,727
...worries about rent, losing their job,
can't pay off a house.

417
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:05,294
(Narrator) On a bigger scale, the profit motive

418
00:25:05,435 --> 00:25:08,235
creates a ruthless cycle of devastation.

419
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:13,128
Illness, pollution, and war
are accepted as normal.

420
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,181
[H. R. McMaster - USA Commanding General]
You have sort of a wartime economy

421
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:18,697
that begins to be self-perpetuating.

422
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:23,683
You have powerful people
inside of a power vacuum really

423
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:26,920
who see it as in their interest
to perpetuate the conflict.

424
00:25:28,72 --> 00:25:31,661
(Narrator) But it does benefit
the few at the top who live parasitically

425
00:25:31,802 --> 00:25:35,17
by the manipulation and control of money.

426
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:42,47
[Dylan Ratigan, Author & Host] The banking system
right now is effectively enslaving individuals

427
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:45,415
enslaving students, enslaving institutions

428
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:47,813
and sucking resources from them.

429
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,533
[Karen Hudes, Economist & Lawyer] They set it up
so that there would be private central banks

430
00:25:53,8 --> 00:25:55,814
that could charge everybody
interest on the currency

431
00:25:55,954 --> 00:26:00,171
and allow themselves to get rich
without having to do anything.

432
00:26:01,12 --> 00:26:04,992
Who's been doing all of this?
It's a group of bankers,

433
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:08,138
the Federal Reserve System;
that's a private system.

434
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,854
- The Fed is a private bank
owned by private stockholders.

435
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:14,177
Do not let the name 'federal' fool you.

436
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,982
(Karen) In 1913, which is when Woodrow Wilson

437
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:22,446
allowed the Federal Reserve System
legislation to be passed

438
00:26:22,837 --> 00:26:25,15
most of the Congress people had gone home.

439
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,948
(Narrator) This legislation
turned the central bank system

440
00:26:28,88 --> 00:26:31,623
of the United States
over to the Federal Reserve Board

441
00:26:31,763 --> 00:26:35,624
making them the only group
that could issue Federal Reserve notes

442
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:37,959
or US dollars.

443
00:26:39,589 --> 00:26:42,72
(Karen) President Wilson regretted that.

444
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:45,766
He said that he had just
sold this country downstream.

445
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:49,725
"A great industrial nation is controlled
by its system of credit.

446
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:51,868
Our system of credit is concentrated.

447
00:26:52,8 --> 00:26:54,775
The growth of the nation,
therefore, and all our activities

448
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,687
are in the hands of a few men.

449
00:26:56,828 --> 00:26:59,196
We have come to be one of the worst ruled

450
00:26:59,336 --> 00:27:02,425
one of the most completely controlled
and dominated governments

451
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:06,126
in the civilized world;
a government by the opinion and the duress

452
00:27:06,266 --> 00:27:09,30
of small groups of dominant men."

453
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,160
~President Woodrow Wilson, 1916

454
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,840
[Erin Ade, Reporter & Host]
It's a fiat system that we operate under.

455
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,668
It's actually someone punching numbers
on a computer somewhere;

456
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:19,833
that is how we manufacture money today.

457
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,636
(Karen) There's nothing backing it;
there's nothing behind it.

458
00:27:24,97 --> 00:27:26,797
(Narrator) When government spends
more than it collects in taxes

459
00:27:26,797 --> 00:27:29,777
and needs money, it does not print its own money,

460
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:33,541
but borrows from the federal reserve
in exchange for US bonds

461
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:35,492
which the fed provides at interest.

462
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:39,484
When people in corporations want money,
they go to banks as well.

463
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:43,225
The system is rigged. If a bank buys a $100 bond,

464
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:47,310
the bank gets to lend out
10 times that amount, or $1000.

465
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,535
They created the extra funds from nothing:

466
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:52,447
no money, gold, or anything to back it up.

467
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:56,33
The bank also gets back the loans
with interest for all the money lent.

468
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:58,341
Money is created in this way
from the simple signature

469
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:00,963
of a borrower with a promise to pay it back.

470
00:28:01,103 --> 00:28:04,561
To make matters worse, very often,
people are paying the amount back

471
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,68
many times over due to the interest.

472
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:09,798
This is the process by which individuals,

473
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,515
companies and governments acquire money.

474
00:28:12,655 --> 00:28:16,240
It is respectably referred to as
'fractional reserve lending'

475
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,302
and is used globally by most other banking systems

476
00:28:19,442 --> 00:28:24,868
keeping people and entire nations in perpetual debt.

477
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:29,385
(Karen) If you just keep printing dollars
with no backing, at a certain point

478
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:33,316
people lose confidence in the currency,
and that's what has happened.

479
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:37,986
(Dylan) The banking system right now
is in the business of manufacturing risk

480
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:41,561
by creating debt for individuals and people.

481
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:46,235
There is the risk that those people
will not pay that debt back,

482
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:50,634
but the liabilities for the risk have been
and continue to be assigned

483
00:28:50,634 --> 00:28:52,924
to the US taxpayer and the US currency.

484
00:28:53,95 --> 00:28:55,581
(Karen) We're now sitting in a situation

485
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:58,411
where the world's currencies are about to crash.

486
00:28:58,551 --> 00:29:02,660
Nobody knows how long it's going to take,
but the Federal Reserve System

487
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:05,764
has been printing dollars like there's no tomorrow.

488
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:08,588
(Dylan) You have what is effectively
a criminal enterprise

489
00:29:08,728 --> 00:29:11,793
based on the manipulation
of people's attention, resources

490
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:14,655
and time, in order to extract value from them.

491
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:17,402
(Karen) They're stealing money from us that way.

492
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:21,440
They're stealing the results
of our efforts and our labor.

493
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:26,220
(Dylan) That is something that has grown
as a cancer on our society.

494
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:30,245
(Karen) These bankers are all part of a system

495
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:33,45
called the Bank for International Settlements.

496
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:35,889
- Most people, even in business
and banking, don't understand

497
00:29:36,30 --> 00:29:38,591
this bank and its role; the BIS.

498
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:42,61
(Karen) They own 40% of the assets

499
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:45,838
of the 43,000 companies that are
traded on the capital markets.

500
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:49,607
- The bank runs itself.
It has a board of directors which is composed

501
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,559
of 15 governors of central banks
from around the world.

502
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:55,880
(Karen) ...and they pull down 60% of the annual earnings.

503
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,614
They bought off all our media,
and that media is hoodwinking citizens.

504
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:04,716
(Abby) The media's morphed into just
peddling the corporate interests of

505
00:30:04,857 --> 00:30:08,303
the money masters
that control the political establishment.

506
00:30:08,444 --> 00:30:11,216
There's about 118 boards of directors that sit

507
00:30:11,357 --> 00:30:13,936
on these five giant media corporations.

508
00:30:14,76 --> 00:30:17,725
They all serve different boards, from Monsanto

509
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:20,422
to weapons, to food...

510
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:22,909
When you have all these interests bleeding together,

511
00:30:23,50 --> 00:30:24,913
it's that much harder to differentiate

512
00:30:25,53 --> 00:30:27,922
what interests you're seeing
laid out in the mainstream media.

513
00:30:29,33 --> 00:30:31,194
(TV Announcer) Fair, balanced.

514
00:30:32,348 --> 00:30:35,128
(Dylan) If you want to understand power,
you have to understand

515
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:37,631
who nominates candidates,

516
00:30:38,10 --> 00:30:41,25
not understand who votes for candidates.

517
00:30:41,85 --> 00:30:43,38
Our system is not a democracy.

518
00:30:43,178 --> 00:30:47,258
The percentage of our population that
participates in the nomination process

519
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:51,341
is literally less than 5% of the population

520
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:56,247
and really less than 1% of the population.

521
00:30:56,395 --> 00:31:03,197
If I was in control of the nominating process

522
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:05,795
of everything that everybody ate

523
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:09,83
and I always nominated
cheeseburgers or fried chicken,

524
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:12,518
and I told you that it was a democracy
and you could eat anything you want

525
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:15,3
as long as it was a cheeseburger or fried chicken.

526
00:31:15,143 --> 00:31:18,75
Would that be a democracy?
I could sell it to you as a democracy

527
00:31:18,75 --> 00:31:20,625
because I don't decide whether you eat
cheeseburgers or fried chicken.

528
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:24,500
You get to vote in a very large
and well-publicized election

529
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,628
as to whether we're going with
fried chicken or cheeseburgers

530
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:30,664
as people organize into very tribal groups

531
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:34,400
very anti-fried chicken and very pro-cheeseburger

532
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,627
or, they'll explain to you exactly why
cheeseburgers are going to be

533
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:41,255
the end of the world,
and why fried chicken is going to save you.

534
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:44,122
WHO MAKES THE RULES?

535
00:31:44,425 --> 00:31:45,793
(Narrator) Those who can afford it

536
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:49,18
hire lobbyists who essentially buy politicians.

537
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:51,847
Most of the time,
either party will suit their needs.

538
00:31:51,987 --> 00:31:55,207
[Professor James Thurber, Host] The definition
of a lobbyist in the United States is someone

539
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:59,42
who advocates for someone else
and is getting paid for it.

540
00:31:59,915 --> 00:32:02,892
(Narrator) The laws then enacted
are quite often written

541
00:32:03,32 --> 00:32:05,685
by the corporations to benefit themselves.

542
00:32:06,61 --> 00:32:09,893
Professor Thurber sees
an underground explosion in lobbying

543
00:32:10,33 --> 00:32:14,957
and estimates the industry actually brings in
more than $9 billion a year

544
00:32:15,98 --> 00:32:18,413
exceeded only by tourism and government.

545
00:32:19,85 --> 00:32:21,332
- The reason that we aren't
changing things right now is

546
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:25,722
the banks have lobbyists in Washington
in numbers I've never seen.

547
00:32:26,12 --> 00:32:28,773
(Narrator) Lobbyists are
strictly there to buy access.

548
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:32,326
They are not there to
enhance the democratic process.

549
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:36,328
Families and working people just don't have
that kind of representation,

550
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:39,889
power or influence to look after their needs.

551
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:44,468
- They have designed the system
to reinforce and, in a sense,

552
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:47,657
finance themselves based off of special interests.

553
00:32:47,797 --> 00:32:50,435
(Erin) Everything that was around in 2007-2008

554
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:53,182
that we got so scared about,
the mortgage-backed securities,

555
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,590
the credit default swaps, the other derivatives:

556
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:59,229
They still exist. They absolutely do.

557
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:01,927
Yes, there are higher
capital requirements for the banks

558
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:05,773
so they can't be as leveraged,
but those are not that high.

559
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:09,455
(Abby) If we don't have a media that's providing

560
00:33:09,595 --> 00:33:12,934
who's really writing these bills
and passing this legislation

561
00:33:13,74 --> 00:33:16,382
and what it's all for and who it serves,

562
00:33:16,522 --> 00:33:18,736
then we're living in an illusion.

563
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:25,726
[Paul Wright, Author] Generally, the laws
in this country are written by the wealthy

564
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:28,157
and the powerful because
I think, by definition, that's

565
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,424
who controls the legislatures and

566
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:35,26
the commanding heights of
the power system in this country.

567
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,110
(Erin) That's a scary reality because

568
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:41,493
you can pay your way into having laws implemented

569
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:45,365
that serve you and your corporation
as you'd like them to serve.

570
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:49,458
(Abby) The complete impunity
that corporations have

571
00:33:49,598 --> 00:33:52,861
to operate unabated and
pollute the entire planet...

572
00:33:53,2 --> 00:33:55,427
- A major spill of toxic coal ash

573
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,503
is raising questions again
about the safety of water

574
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:01,454
and the government regulators overseeing industry.

575
00:34:01,594 --> 00:34:04,664
(Abby) There's zero accountability,
other than the slap on the wrist

576
00:34:04,704 --> 00:34:07,726
of a couple fines here and then,
I mean slave labor

577
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:11,764
to the exploitation of resources on the planet.

578
00:34:12,304 --> 00:34:15,856
(Narrator) The slap on the wrist of
industries that pollute, cut corners

579
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:20,888
and violate policies will continue,
as long as it's profitable to do so.

580
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:25,000
(Erin) JP Morgan paid $13 billion (US) in fines last year!

581
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:27,501
If you have that much money
in order to just pay fines...

582
00:34:27,641 --> 00:34:30,681
and they put away $19 billion (US),
for paying fines!

583
00:34:31,118 --> 00:34:34,292
(Reporter) JP Morgan is paying
$410 million (US) to settle charges

584
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:37,835
with the government,
but JP Morgan is not admitting any wrongdoing.

585
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:41,886
(Reporter) Goldman Sachs settled
early on in this case for $550 million

586
00:34:41,987 --> 00:34:43,262
without admitting wrongdoing.

587
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:46,362
(Reporter) UBS has agreed
to pay about $50 million.

588
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:50,199
Under the terms of the settlement,
UBS did not admit any wrongdoing.

589
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,339
(Paul) I think that people commit
the crimes that they're

590
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:54,495
in a social position to commit.

591
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:57,243
I think it's Bertold Brecht that asked
"Which is a greater crime:

592
00:34:57,383 --> 00:34:59,551
to rob a bank or to own one?"

593
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:03,716
I think as we've seen from everything
from the savings and loan scandals

594
00:35:03,856 --> 00:35:07,481
to the Wall Street meltdown,
that all too often the owners of the banks

595
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:10,629
are frequently looting
the institutions that employ them.

596
00:35:10,669 --> 00:35:13,522
They commit all manner of illegal acts

597
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:16,39
and yet they're very rarely prosecuted for them.

598
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:20,888
Throughout history,
there's been very little pretense

599
00:35:21,28 --> 00:35:26,220
that the government has also
acted as an agent for the wealthy class.

600
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,590
(Erin) Yes, there might be idealistic
politicians that got into the game to

601
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:34,283
change the world,
but if they're good -any good at their job-

602
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,727
they're no longer changing the world.
They're serving the interests

603
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:39,781
of their donors if they want
to rise in the world of politics.

604
00:35:40,21 --> 00:35:42,429
(Jacque) They say, "Write to your Congressman."

605
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:45,140
Who the hell is this jackass
that you have to write?

606
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,445
He should be at the forefront
of technology and knowledge.

607
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:50,924
You don't have to write to him.

608
00:35:51,64 --> 00:35:54,89
I'm sure most of you have flown in airliners.

609
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,644
You don't have to write to the pilot saying
"You're flying at an angle!

610
00:35:57,784 --> 00:36:00,392
Straighten out, god dammit!"

611
00:36:00,532 --> 00:36:03,371
He knows his business;
that's how he got the job!

612
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:06,411
The people in Washington now
are lawyers and businessmen

613
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:10,149
and can solve no problems.

614
00:36:11,35 --> 00:36:14,678
(Erin) If the bottom line is a profit-driven world,
then those interests

615
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:17,842
are going to be served first,
and everything is going to be secondary.

616
00:36:17,982 --> 00:36:20,196
That's the sad reality of it.

617
00:36:20,564 --> 00:36:23,560
(Abby) There is no value system that is put out there

618
00:36:23,596 --> 00:36:25,888
that is actually beneficial to humanity

619
00:36:25,888 --> 00:36:29,152
because it's based on
consumerism and profit making.

620
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:33,203
(Jacque) We use artificial pumping
in animals to make them grow faster.

621
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:38,822
If you can multiply the cells in a chicken faster,
you can sell it sooner.

622
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,476
Does that have an effect on the human body?

623
00:36:41,482 --> 00:36:45,104
They don't worry about that.
They worry about the sale of chickens.

624
00:36:46,327 --> 00:36:50,759
(Narrator) Wealth is going to the rich
faster than at any other time in history.

625
00:36:51,139 --> 00:36:56,198
(Abby) The success of the industrialized world
has been dependent on the failure

626
00:36:56,338 --> 00:36:58,995
and the lack of development
of the developing world.

627
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:01,377
The reason that they are stifled
is because they are

628
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:04,402
indebted to the first world;
we wouldn't be prospering

629
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:08,775
if it weren't for the labor that's going on
and the indentured servitude

630
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:11,367
that's going on in the entire developing country.

631
00:37:11,386 --> 00:37:14,509
So the power dynamic
can never change in that respect

632
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:18,76
because it's literally dependent
on it being that way.

633
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:20,902
(Reporter) The dirty and
dangerous work done by children.

634
00:37:21,42 --> 00:37:24,23
The jobs down in the pits
are typically reserved for teenagers

635
00:37:24,163 --> 00:37:27,23
with only tree limbs to brace the mine walls.

636
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,530
The risk to them is real.

637
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:33,464
- Rich governments like to say that
they're helping poor countries develop,

638
00:37:33,604 --> 00:37:35,961
but who is developing who here?

639
00:37:36,101 --> 00:37:39,46
Each year poor countries are
paying about 600 billion (US)

640
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:41,39
in debt service to rich countries

641
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:44,348
on loans that have already
been paid off many times over.

642
00:37:44,488 --> 00:37:47,408
Then there's the money that
poor countries lose from trade rules

643
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:49,824
imposed by rich countries.

644
00:37:49,964 --> 00:37:54,602
Altogether, that's more than $2 trillion (US) every year.

645
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:00,328
(Narrator) Money systems
have existed for centuries,

646
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:03,988
and whether we realize it or not,
have always been used to control behavior

647
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:07,447
by limiting the purchasing power
of the majority of people.

648
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:11,183
One example of this
is the criminal justice system.

649
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,790
Many proclaim that prisons don't work.

650
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,110
But ultimately, prisons are a resounding success

651
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,125
as a tool for social control to safeguard

652
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,632
the political and economic established system.

653
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:28,46
(Paul) If you hire people
whose only expertise is caging

654
00:38:28,186 --> 00:38:30,786
people to try to fix social problems,

655
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:32,956
youâre not going to get a very good solution.

656
00:38:33,57 --> 00:38:35,808
But I think theyâre very good at caging people

657
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:39,154
and I think thatâs why mass incarceration has been

658
00:38:39,294 --> 00:38:42,283
a huge success for the ruling class in this country.

659
00:38:42,628 --> 00:38:45,14
The United States is really
number one in a lot of things

660
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:47,901
and I think the biggest thing where
we can say weâre number one in

661
00:38:48,41 --> 00:38:49,733
is how many people we lock up.

662
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:53,352
The United States has roughly
5% of the worldâs population

663
00:38:53,492 --> 00:38:56,155
but weâve got 25% of the worldâs prisoners.

664
00:38:56,423 --> 00:38:59,622
China has 4 times as many people
as the United States does

665
00:38:59,723 --> 00:39:01,241
and half as many prisoners.

666
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:04,596
The United States has more prisoners
than the Soviet Union did

667
00:39:04,737 --> 00:39:07,285
at the height of the purges
and the collectivization

668
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:10,535
in the 1930s and the infamous Soviet gulag.

669
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:14,881
CONSEQUENCES OF POVERTY

670
00:39:15,216 --> 00:39:19,449
(Narrator) Poverty is a vicious cycle
rarely escaped by the poor.

671
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:23,607
Studies found that scarcity
can reduce mental capacity

672
00:39:23,747 --> 00:39:25,700
and cognitive performance.

673
00:39:25,955 --> 00:39:30,181
In children, it affects their
brain development and memory.

674
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,857
Additionally, the poor are often forced

675
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:35,627
to live in areas of low air quality.

676
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:40,248
Far from being a problem for only the poor,

677
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:43,588
all areas of the socioeconomic spectrum suffer

678
00:39:43,728 --> 00:39:47,853
when our air, food and water
are polluted by fossil fuel emissions

679
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,71
and radiation from nuclear accidents.

680
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:53,232
PLANETARY IMPACT

681
00:39:53,345 --> 00:39:57,913
[Mark Jacobson, Engineering, Stanford] The current
energy infrastructure results in about 2.5 to 4 million

682
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,25
deaths per year, worldwide,
from respiratory disease,

683
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:05,284
cardiovascular disease
and complications from asthma.

684
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,909
(Reporter) Weâre in downtown Beijing
and the pollution ratings

685
00:40:07,977 --> 00:40:09,929
have once again gone off the charts.

686
00:40:10,43 --> 00:40:14,454
Readings are around 25 times
World Health Organizationâs standards.

687
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:18,525
(Mark) ...including 50 to 100,000 deaths
per year in the United States

688
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:20,991
and 16,000 alone in California.

689
00:40:21,353 --> 00:40:24,42
(Abby) The economic system that weâre living in today
is destroying the planet

690
00:40:24,53 --> 00:40:27,17
because it is based on an unsustainable model.

691
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,636
Weâre seeing proof of that right now.

692
00:40:29,747 --> 00:40:33,995
(Mark) The current energy infrastructure,
which has been going on for a long time

693
00:40:34,136 --> 00:40:38,764
has resulted in the accumulation
of green house gases and

694
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,45
particles that cause
warming of the Earthâs climate.

695
00:40:43,99 --> 00:40:46,331
The Earthâs climate is warming
at a rate faster than any time

696
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:48,507
since deglaciation from the last ice age.

697
00:40:48,556 --> 00:40:50,409
WHAT ARE THE REAL COSTS?

698
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,478
In addition, the higher CO2 levels:

699
00:40:52,478 --> 00:40:56,556
CO2 is [a molecule] that dissolves in water
and becomes carbonic acid

700
00:40:56,696 --> 00:40:59,357
and has resulted in the
acidification of the oceans.

701
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,827
This is destroying coral reefs.

702
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:10,96
(Jeff) We have to realize our planet
does have a certain amount of

703
00:41:10,236 --> 00:41:14,31
regenerative power and there is no question that

704
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:18,383
weâve been through numerous worldwide extinctions.

705
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:22,582
We have fossil records of that
and the Earth has recovered.

706
00:41:22,722 --> 00:41:25,281
There is a limiting carrying capacity though.

707
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:28,244
(Mark) There are many
additional impacts of global warming.

708
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:31,955
Sea level rise is a very big concern, for example:

709
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,729
right now there are about
65 to 70 meters of sea level stored in ice

710
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:40,198
mostly in the Antarctic,
but also in glaciers in Greenland

711
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:43,535
and also sea ice in the Arctic and other places.

712
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:46,443
The temperature is warm enough that...
If we melt all this ice,

713
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,255
that means the sea levels will rise 65 to 70 meters

714
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:54,100
and that will cover 7% of all the worldâs land and...

715
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:57,908
All this is along the coast
where most people in the world live,

716
00:41:58,48 --> 00:42:00,665
this will cause a significant disaster.

717
00:42:01,67 --> 00:42:06,378
Weâre also seeing enhanced storminess,
increased intensity of hurricanes,

718
00:42:06,518 --> 00:42:10,631
and greater extremes of weather
associated with global warming.

719
00:42:10,771 --> 00:42:14,848
There are significant problems associated with this
and these are all tied back

720
00:42:15,35 --> 00:42:18,466
to the emissions from coal, oil and gas combustion

721
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:21,887
that have been occurring
since the industrial revolution

722
00:42:22,27 --> 00:42:25,319
that started in the mid to late 1700s.

723
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:30,540
"Is Earth the insane asylum of the universe?"

724
00:42:31,297 --> 00:42:35,253
(Narrator) It is probable that
war itself could be our undoing

725
00:42:35,393 --> 00:42:37,743
let alone the environment.

726
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:42,318
Our brutal competitive behaviors
are not human nature

727
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:47,525
but simply a result of scarcity,
making us all competitors

728
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:52,372
in the fight to attain what we need to survive.

729
00:42:56,59 --> 00:42:59,849
While scarcity is naturally occurring,

730
00:42:59,989 --> 00:43:04,648
it's also intentional in industries
and governments for profit

731
00:43:04,788 --> 00:43:07,46
and national interest.

732
00:43:08,277 --> 00:43:11,349
As long as nations are immersed in scarcity

733
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:15,561
we will continue to have conflicts between people.

734
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:18,375
Crimes, murder

735
00:43:19,265 --> 00:43:21,522
and other violence

736
00:43:22,562 --> 00:43:24,960
to all out war;

737
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:29,131
the ultimate expression of human stupidity.

738
00:43:30,628 --> 00:43:32,128
- Bomb the heck out of them!

739
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:36,154
These behaviors must be surpassed
if we wish to survive.

740
00:43:36,294 --> 00:43:39,808
- Drop the bombs on them!
- It's the best recruiting tool for al-Qaeda

741
00:43:39,949 --> 00:43:43,322
This guarantees the cycle of violence will go on.

742
00:43:43,462 --> 00:43:46,938
(Narrator) With our technological ability
to provide for all

743
00:43:47,78 --> 00:43:50,317
we must take steps toward a different approach.

744
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:53,735
Or the endless cycle of booms, busts

745
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,707
and war will continue.

746
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:02,627
- (sarcastic) Oh, no! Peace in our time.
Aye yai yai!

747
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:09,993
"If we don't end war, war will end us."
~ H G Wells, 1936

748
00:44:11,87 --> 00:44:13,833
(Dylan) Nobody including
-most of all- the United States

749
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:17,192
goes to war to liberate or spread democracy.

750
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:20,272
The only incentive on a
practical level to go to war

751
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:23,64
is to acquire resources.

752
00:44:23,366 --> 00:44:27,849
In the United States' case,
it frequently is either energy resources

753
00:44:28,347 --> 00:44:31,183
[or] shall I say supporting political alliances

754
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:34,221
to preserve access to energy resources.

755
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:38,804
(Narrator) Smedley Butler,
a US Marine Corps General Major,

756
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:42,12
who was the most decorated marine
at the time of his death

757
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:45,181
stated it well when he wrote:

758
00:44:45,321 --> 00:44:49,371
"I spent 33 years and four months
in active military service

759
00:44:49,511 --> 00:44:52,7
and during that period I spent most of my time

760
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:55,118
as a high class muscle man for Big Business,

761
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:57,611
for Wall Street and the bankers.

762
00:44:58,102 --> 00:45:00,620
In short, I was a racketeer,

763
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,373
a gangster for capitalism.

764
00:45:03,803 --> 00:45:07,238
I helped make Mexico safe
for American oil interests.

765
00:45:07,784 --> 00:45:10,830
I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place

766
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,580
for the National City Bank boys
to collect revenues in.

767
00:45:15,142 --> 00:45:18,629
I helped in the raping of
half a dozen Central American republics

768
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:21,245
for the benefit of Wall Street.

769
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:23,875
I helped purify Nicaragua

770
00:45:24,16 --> 00:45:26,414
for the International
Banking House of Brown Brothers.

771
00:45:26,554 --> 00:45:30,602
I brought light to the Dominican Republic
for the American sugar interests.

772
00:45:30,742 --> 00:45:34,534
I helped make Honduras right
for the American fruit companies.

773
00:45:34,674 --> 00:45:39,589
In China, I helped see to it that
Standard Oil went on its way unmolested.

774
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,774
Looking back on it, I might have
given Al Capone a few hints.

775
00:45:44,914 --> 00:45:48,924
The best that he could do was to
operate his racket in three districts.

776
00:45:49,515 --> 00:45:51,823
I operated on three continents.

777
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:56,9
War is a racket. It always has been.

778
00:45:56,149 --> 00:46:00,214
A few profit and the many pay.
But there is a way to stop it.

779
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:02,979
You can't end it by disarmament conferences.

780
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,192
It can be smashed effectively
only by taking the profit out of war."

781
00:46:12,388 --> 00:46:17,2
(Jacque) Our universities today
are better equipped than ever:

782
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:20,984
...best scientific equipment,
the bombs are getting worse.

783
00:46:21,124 --> 00:46:24,455
The wars are getting worse.
The killing is getting worse.

784
00:46:24,596 --> 00:46:28,3
You don't need to kill people, bomb cities.

785
00:46:28,143 --> 00:46:30,880
There's something wrong with our culture; very wrong!

786
00:46:31,184 --> 00:46:33,614
(Narrator) To blame any individual or corporation

787
00:46:33,754 --> 00:46:37,953
does not get at the root causes of the problems.

788
00:46:38,94 --> 00:46:42,115
The structure of our socioeconomic system,
itself, has everyone out

789
00:46:42,255 --> 00:46:44,855
to meet their own needs,

790
00:46:44,995 --> 00:46:48,491
creating a predatory, competitive environment.

791
00:46:49,565 --> 00:46:52,544
Attempting to find solutions
to the monumental problems

792
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:56,974
within our present society
will only serve as temporary patchwork

793
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,615
prolonging what is quickly becoming
an obsolete system.

794
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:06,795
PART III

795
00:47:12,632 --> 00:47:13,937
(Narrator) Now, more than ever

796
00:47:13,938 --> 00:47:18,886
a sustainable civilization is possible
and furthermore, essential.

797
00:47:22,939 --> 00:47:28,808
Our social designs, language, and values
have evolved from ages ago.

798
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:34,382
The reality of scarcity in earlier times
shaped our behaviors

799
00:47:34,383 --> 00:47:38,598
and remains deeply entrenched
in all cultures today.

800
00:47:40,651 --> 00:47:43,837
The history of civilization is a story of change

801
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:47,917
and this includes our social systems, as well.

802
00:47:53,378 --> 00:47:57,596
Our earliest enlightenments
were but stepping stones

803
00:47:57,775 --> 00:48:02,52
in the sequential development
to our present science and technology,

804
00:48:02,128 --> 00:48:10,98
which could now produce
and distribute abundance to everyone.

805
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,920
THE MARCH OF EVENTS

806
00:48:18,921 --> 00:48:21,870
[Erik Brynjolfsson Ph.D, MIT] There's no question
that many jobs simply aren't coming back.

807
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,312
But probably the single biggest driver of that

808
00:48:24,314 --> 00:48:27,366
is the way that technology is racing ahead.

809
00:48:27,368 --> 00:48:29,920
If we continue on current paths,

810
00:48:29,921 --> 00:48:33,415
the next 10 years will be
even more disruptive than the last 10 years

811
00:48:33,606 --> 00:48:36,647
because the technology is accelerating faster.

812
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:38,480
(Jacque) If you keep laying off people

813
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:41,864
and putting in machines,
which is happening in the auto industry...

814
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,431
they pick up the whole car and
turn it around, shove the engine in...

815
00:48:45,815 --> 00:48:47,219
They're moving people out.

816
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:49,000
There comes a time when

817
00:48:49,2 --> 00:48:52,93
millions won't have the
purchasing power to buy cars.

818
00:48:52,94 --> 00:48:54,339
That's when the system collapses.

819
00:48:54,403 --> 00:48:57,71
- All of our growth is associated
with increased consumption,

820
00:48:57,72 --> 00:48:59,730
increased use of energy, and other resources

821
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:02,387
And when you ask economists
"Well, what's the alternative

822
00:49:02,387 --> 00:49:04,411
that enables us to continue to be prosperous

823
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:07,992
without destroying the natural environment
on which we depend?",

824
00:49:07,992 --> 00:49:10,510
they don't seem to have an answer for that.

825
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:16,266
(Jacque) There's no solution within
the present-day type society.

826
00:49:19,275 --> 00:49:25,295
(Narrator) The Venus Project
proposes a workable alternative.

827
00:49:31,684 --> 00:49:34,543
The aim of The Venus Project is to secure,

828
00:49:34,949 --> 00:49:36,250
protect,

829
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,164
and assure a more humane world for all,

830
00:49:39,164 --> 00:49:42,429
through the application
of technology and cybernetics

831
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:45,724
with human and environmental concern.

832
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:55,543
(Jacque) People need information to be able
to move into the future intelligently.

833
00:49:55,543 --> 00:50:02,632
Without information, there's no way you can
develop a sustainable culture.

834
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:07,994
It can't be done politically,
because the problems are technical.

835
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:15,660
If you succeeded in arranging for the most
ethical people in the world

836
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,612
of the highest morality

837
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:19,459
and put them in government,

838
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:22,404
when the lights fail in your house,
you still need an electrician.

839
00:50:22,405 --> 00:50:25,461
When the dams don't generate enough electricity,

840
00:50:25,461 --> 00:50:28,160
you don't need a highly moral politician.

841
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:30,620
You need an electrical engineer.

842
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,803
So our problems in the world
can be solved by technical people.

843
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:42,464
The Venus Project applies
the methods of science to the social system.

844
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:45,297
[Lawrence Krauss, Theoretical Physics, ASU]
What science does provide for us,

845
00:50:45,297 --> 00:50:46,900
is a great deal of information

846
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,346
about the implications
of the different options we have.

847
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:55,94
So, science helps us make better decisions
by informing those decisions.

848
00:50:55,194 --> 00:51:00,476
That's why it's a shame to
turn away from science in the public arena.

849
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,821
[Paul Hewitt, "Conceptual Physics"] Science is
not an emotional way, not a wishful thinking way

850
00:51:04,821 --> 00:51:07,596
but a rational way of
seeing what the connections are.

851
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,9
That's what science is about.

852
00:51:09,9 --> 00:51:11,359
How could that not apply to everything?

853
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,778
(Lawrence) The scientific method, quite simply,

854
00:51:13,778 --> 00:51:17,821
is a process by which you can try to distinguish

855
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:21,831
what accurately describes the universe
from what doesn't.

856
00:51:22,10 --> 00:51:23,779
It involves several steps.

857
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:26,429
Often, of course,
you make some supposition or prediction

858
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:30,64
about what phenomena might result,
based on some theory.

859
00:51:30,64 --> 00:51:33,660
But then, most importantly,
use empirical data - testing.

860
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,613
You test your idea in a way that's falsifiable.

861
00:51:36,613 --> 00:51:39,377
(Jacque) When they said to scientists
"Can you put a man on the moon?"

862
00:51:39,377 --> 00:51:41,487
They answered, "I don't know."

863
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:43,262
They asked, "How do you find out?"

864
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:45,479
"Well, we have to put a guy in a centrifuge

865
00:51:45,479 --> 00:51:47,410
and spin him to see when he conks out.

866
00:51:47,411 --> 00:51:49,834
Then we'll know how fast the rocket can go.

867
00:51:49,834 --> 00:51:53,575
We can't start out at 7 miles per second.
The guy will flatten out."

868
00:51:53,628 --> 00:51:56,193
After they try all these things, then they say

869
00:51:56,193 --> 00:51:58,752
"Here's what we have to do
to get a man on the moon."

870
00:51:58,752 --> 00:52:01,866
(Lawrence) You have to perform additional tests
that are more selective

871
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:04,844
to determine, in fact, how accurate your idea is.

872
00:52:04,844 --> 00:52:09,360
And science continues by the process of
continually testing your ideas.

873
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,277
(Paul) If you're going to get
into nature, you're going to

874
00:52:11,277 --> 00:52:14,345
get into the rules by which nature operates.

875
00:52:14,503 --> 00:52:17,666
And it does operate by very specific rules.

876
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:19,702
Which means it's predictable.

877
00:52:19,779 --> 00:52:22,43
And so, what is science, for me?

878
00:52:22,43 --> 00:52:24,284
It's more than a body of knowledge.

879
00:52:24,284 --> 00:52:25,848
It's a way of thinking.

880
00:52:25,848 --> 00:52:33,85
LANGUAGE OF SCIENCE

881
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:37,202
(Jacque) Now language, itself,
is subject to interpretation.

882
00:52:37,202 --> 00:52:40,396
When you say something,
it goes through my filters

883
00:52:40,396 --> 00:52:42,993
and comes out a little different
than what you mean.

884
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,970
Now, if you had that in the
scientific world - engineering world...

885
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:52,167
When engineers talk to each other,
they use physical referent for their language.

886
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:55,528
If they all interpreted what
they think the other guy meant,

887
00:52:55,528 --> 00:52:57,901
you couldn't build bridges; they'd collapse.

888
00:52:57,901 --> 00:53:02,971
In medicine, when a doctor says, "Hemostat",
the nurse doesn't hand him a towel.

889
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:04,274
She hands him a hemostat.

890
00:53:04,374 --> 00:53:06,651
So that language is very precise.

891
00:53:06,729 --> 00:53:09,674
(Lawrence) The thing about science is that
it's independent of culture, religion,

892
00:53:09,675 --> 00:53:10,882
language, everything.

893
00:53:10,882 --> 00:53:13,290
That's why scientists around the world
can work together.

894
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,387
We all speak the same language.

895
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:17,375
(Jacque) They're talking specifically.

896
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:19,782
The wonderful thing about a blueprint...

897
00:53:19,782 --> 00:53:22,708
If you give a blueprint of an automobile to Italy,

898
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:26,310
China, France...
They all turn out the same automobile.

899
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,502
Because it has uniform interpretation.

900
00:53:28,602 --> 00:53:29,993
(Lawrence) I was just giving a lecture about

901
00:53:29,994 --> 00:53:32,627
two very important results
which vastly disagreed.

902
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:35,129
What did the two groups do who vastly disagreed?

903
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,693
They decided to work together.

904
00:53:36,693 --> 00:53:39,607
Their interest was in
determining what nature tells us,

905
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:41,353
not what they wanted to be true.

906
00:53:41,353 --> 00:53:44,875
(Jacque) There's no Chinese way
of building airplanes.

907
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:46,917
There's a mathematical way.

908
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:52,375
(Narrator) Oddly enough, we've never applied
the methods of science and engineering

909
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:58,201
on a global scale to achieve a more just
and equitable social arrangement.

910
00:53:58,615 --> 00:54:06,171
Our failure to do so, leaves us continuously
on the brink of oblivion.

911
00:54:06,706 --> 00:54:12,626
(Jacque) Scientists were never asked to
design a society without automobile accidents.

912
00:54:12,626 --> 00:54:17,493
They were never asked to
design a city that's self-sufficient.

913
00:54:17,493 --> 00:54:21,241
Take the Manhattan Project.
They were supported.

914
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:23,30
So they built the atom bomb.

915
00:54:23,30 --> 00:54:26,7
We're working on the wrong things!

916
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:31,741
UNIFICATION ON A GLOBAL SCALE

917
00:54:31,788 --> 00:54:36,122
The society that I'm talking about
is global cooperation,

918
00:54:36,123 --> 00:54:40,696
where all of the nations work
toward improving the lot of human kind.

919
00:54:41,138 --> 00:54:42,692
Now why do that?

920
00:54:42,692 --> 00:54:46,996
Because the smarter people are,
the richer and more secure everybody is.

921
00:54:46,996 --> 00:54:51,131
But in the future,
when you join all the nations together,

922
00:54:51,131 --> 00:54:55,634
and they can see the advantage of
sharing all of the Earth's resources

923
00:54:55,634 --> 00:54:59,227
and all of the knowledge by all nations;

924
00:54:59,227 --> 00:55:03,703
Once they realize that advantage,
they will join together.

925
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:05,933
If they do not, they'll kill each other.

926
00:55:06,153 --> 00:55:09,176
- That's what endless warfare's led to; brigandage.

927
00:55:09,276 --> 00:55:10,484
What else could happen?

928
00:55:10,704 --> 00:55:13,590
But we, who are all that are left
of the old engineers and mechanics,

929
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:16,107
have pledged ourselves to salvage the World.

930
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:19,617
We're the last trustees of civilization
when everything else has failed.

931
00:55:20,475 --> 00:55:24,190
WHEN MONEY BECOMES OBSOLETE

932
00:55:24,987 --> 00:55:27,782
(Narrator) If our planet
had a common catastrophic threat,

933
00:55:28,185 --> 00:55:31,12
such as a large meteor heading toward the Earth,

934
00:55:31,112 --> 00:55:34,338
nations would unite
and call upon science and technology

935
00:55:34,338 --> 00:55:36,536
to solve the pending catastrophe.

936
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:38,604
Border disputes would cease.

937
00:55:38,704 --> 00:55:43,591
Bankers, lawyers and businessmen
would be unable to solve the problem.

938
00:55:44,95 --> 00:55:48,703
Resources would be harnessed
without cost or profit.

939
00:55:49,825 --> 00:55:53,946
Today, we face many common threats
far beyond national boundaries.

940
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:02,215
RESOURCE-BASED ECONOMY

941
00:56:02,704 --> 00:56:05,704
(Jacque) In the world today,
we have enough resources

942
00:56:05,704 --> 00:56:08,704
to solve most human problems.

943
00:56:08,807 --> 00:56:11,604
We can build cities, hospitals all over the world

944
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:13,571
if we use resources.

945
00:56:13,748 --> 00:56:16,425
But if you conscripted all the money in the world

946
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:18,44
there's not enough money

947
00:56:18,44 --> 00:56:21,316
to build hospitals and housing all over the world

948
00:56:21,471 --> 00:56:24,339
and finance the education of students.

949
00:56:24,704 --> 00:56:26,796
But we do have enough teachers and enough

950
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,942
buildings we can use for universities.

951
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,704
We have the resources.

952
00:56:30,704 --> 00:56:35,682
Money is an interference;
because it limits our ability

953
00:56:35,704 --> 00:56:37,704
and it limits our dreams.

954
00:56:39,704 --> 00:56:44,123
(Narrator) Imagine the possibilities
of an unprecedented mobilization

955
00:56:44,223 --> 00:56:48,930
of scientific and technical alliances
toward problem solving

956
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:53,411
without the interference of money or politics

957
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:58,441
to initiate global unification and restoration.

958
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,85
This could easily enable
a high standard of living for all.

959
00:57:03,516 --> 00:57:05,308
This is what Jacque Fresco had in mind

960
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:08,166
when he proposed a Resource-Based Economy.

961
00:57:09,151 --> 00:57:12,312
(Jacque) If our planet ran out of resources

962
00:57:12,313 --> 00:57:17,000
no matter how much gold,
or money, or possessions you had

963
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,704
you could not survive.

964
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:24,823
Our entire survival is based upon resources.

965
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:28,364
(Narrator) Growing up in the Great Depression

966
00:57:28,364 --> 00:57:31,37
in the early nineteen thirties in New York City

967
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,676
was a catalyst for his life's work.

968
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:38,7
Jacque explored many different
social alternatives during that time

969
00:57:38,175 --> 00:57:40,285
but all seemed insufficient.

970
00:57:40,694 --> 00:57:43,604
He rejected the obsolete
teaching methods of the time

971
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,604
and was granted
special privileges by his principal.

972
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:51,604
He read books that furthered
his interest in human behavior and social change.

973
00:57:51,828 --> 00:57:54,548
His early research with
training and observing animals

974
00:57:54,564 --> 00:57:59,53
led him to similar findings with people as well.

975
00:58:00,64 --> 00:58:03,538
He concluded that environment shapes our values,

976
00:58:03,762 --> 00:58:05,526
our identity,

977
00:58:05,704 --> 00:58:09,95
and generates our behavior.

978
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:13,504
Fresco witnessed great suffering and scarcity,

979
00:58:13,504 --> 00:58:16,604
even though Earth was abundant with resources.

980
00:58:17,33 --> 00:58:19,703
He saw it was the rules of the game we play by

981
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,505
that were at fault.

982
00:58:21,604 --> 00:58:26,604
Jacque started with a lot of
technical things when he was very young.

983
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:28,704
And what gave him incentive for that,

984
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:30,150
some of the first designs,

985
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:35,605
was that his younger cousin
cut his fingers in a metal fan.

986
00:58:35,704 --> 00:58:38,704
So Jacque came up with a fabric fan.

987
00:58:38,704 --> 00:58:42,704
He was just a little kid,
and he took it to the fan company

988
00:58:42,704 --> 00:58:46,383
and they said,
"Oh, nice idea kid, but it's not practical."

989
00:58:46,414 --> 00:58:48,704
Then a couple of months later,
they came out with it.

990
00:58:49,52 --> 00:58:51,704
This was his first introduction
to the Free Enterprise system.

991
00:58:51,705 --> 00:58:54,506
It's not free, and it's not enterprising.

992
00:58:55,297 --> 00:58:59,604
Fresco grasped the necessity
to develop an entirely new social design

993
00:58:59,826 --> 00:59:02,306
which integrates
the best of science and technology

994
00:59:02,307 --> 00:59:05,406
dedicated toward human
and environmental concern.

995
00:59:06,704 --> 00:59:08,704
To accomplish this holistic approach

996
00:59:08,704 --> 00:59:11,704
Fresco studied and worked
in a wide range of fields

997
00:59:11,808 --> 00:59:14,988
such as architecture,

998
00:59:15,402 --> 00:59:17,638
transportation,

999
00:59:18,33 --> 00:59:19,281
medicine,

1000
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,600
behavioral sciences,

1001
00:59:21,878 --> 00:59:25,63
industrial design,

1002
00:59:25,704 --> 00:59:27,704
and more.

1003
00:59:28,646 --> 00:59:31,945
For most of his life, he has lectured,

1004
00:59:33,40 --> 00:59:35,301
written books,

1005
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:37,993
designed and produced models and media

1006
00:59:38,177 --> 00:59:40,704
to introduce methods that could work for all,

1007
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,167
instead of only a few individuals.

1008
00:59:44,304 --> 00:59:47,116
(Jacque) Sometimes, when you
talk about a new kind of world,

1009
00:59:47,117 --> 00:59:48,796
it frightens people.

1010
00:59:48,925 --> 00:59:52,164
They figure "Well gee, everything is technical.

1011
00:59:52,232 --> 00:59:54,394
What about the human aspect?"

1012
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:57,420
And I had to devise models

1013
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,604
and make buildings and homes

1014
00:59:59,704 --> 01:00:04,517
to show people what kind of home
they might live in, in the future.

1015
01:00:12,7 --> 01:00:15,549
I really don't know what the future will be like,

1016
01:00:15,704 --> 01:00:18,102
but there are possible alternatives.

1017
01:00:18,238 --> 01:00:20,703
Thousands of different alternatives.

1018
01:00:30,479 --> 01:00:32,604
(Narrator) Fresco and
co-founder, Roxanne Meadows,

1019
01:00:32,704 --> 01:00:37,264
built the experimental structures
to test and illustrate his designs

1020
01:00:37,264 --> 01:00:39,864
and provide a research center
from which to continue

1021
01:00:40,64 --> 01:00:42,848
furthering the aims and proposals.

1022
01:00:43,442 --> 01:00:45,704
We moved here in about 1980

1023
01:00:45,704 --> 01:00:48,464
and this was all flat tomato patch, most of it.

1024
01:00:48,464 --> 01:00:50,703
We got 10 acres and then another 10 acres.

1025
01:00:50,704 --> 01:00:53,302
Jacque wanted an island in the Caribbean

1026
01:00:53,303 --> 01:00:55,705
which was $800,000 (US).  We couldn't afford it

1027
01:00:55,705 --> 01:00:59,558
so we settled on $1,000 an acre, here in Venus.

1028
01:01:00,64 --> 01:01:02,703
So, we made it look like a tropical island.

1029
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:05,604
We planted hundreds of palm trees and fruit trees

1030
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,704
and dug the waterways.

1031
01:01:07,704 --> 01:01:09,64
And then the animals came.

1032
01:01:09,64 --> 01:01:11,64
We have deer,

1033
01:01:11,64 --> 01:01:15,504
lots of alligators, bear, fox, raccoons...

1034
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:18,504
So it's really living in harmony with nature here.

1035
01:01:20,64 --> 01:01:23,923
This is kind of an example of what
the outskirts of Jacque's cities would be like.

1036
01:01:24,133 --> 01:01:26,557
There would be one building
very close to another building,

1037
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,482
but there's so many trees in between

1038
01:01:28,591 --> 01:01:31,124
that it looks like you're living in a forest.

1039
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:33,704
(Jacque) So what the Venus Project really wants

1040
01:01:33,704 --> 01:01:38,782
is to unify all the nations of the world
towards common goals, such as;

1041
01:01:38,783 --> 01:01:42,379
clean air, clean water, non-contaminated food

1042
01:01:42,704 --> 01:01:44,704
and make that available to everyone.

1043
01:01:44,704 --> 01:01:49,328
INTELLIGENT MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES

1044
01:01:49,964 --> 01:01:51,937
What is really needed

1045
01:01:51,938 --> 01:01:56,237
is the intelligent management
of the Earth's resources.

1046
01:01:56,358 --> 01:02:01,899
A Resource-Based Economy is
based on the carrying capacity of the Earth

1047
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,574
and its resources.

1048
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:07,866
If you don't work in terms of existing resources

1049
01:02:07,985 --> 01:02:11,158
you're working in some metaphysical plan.

1050
01:02:11,258 --> 01:02:15,801
In a Resource-Based Economy,
all resources would become

1051
01:02:15,958 --> 01:02:19,451
the common heritage of all the world's people.

1052
01:02:19,451 --> 01:02:22,692
And access to the necessities of life

1053
01:02:22,745 --> 01:02:25,854
would be for all the world's people.

1054
01:02:26,137 --> 01:02:29,771
There would be no more monetary systems

1055
01:02:29,771 --> 01:02:37,358
or trade, barter,
or any other system of human servitude.

1056
01:02:38,718 --> 01:02:42,163
(Narrator) A Resource-Based Economy
allows social advancement

1057
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,258
and worldwide reconstruction

1058
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:47,340
in the shortest time possible.

1059
01:02:47,518 --> 01:02:50,175
(Jacque) Under scientific scales of performance

1060
01:02:50,176 --> 01:02:53,209
we could provide everybody
with more than they need.

1061
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:57,499
I'm saying that the
average person in this Venus Project

1062
01:02:57,533 --> 01:03:01,658
will live better than
the wealthiest people today.

1063
01:03:03,603 --> 01:03:06,258
(Roxanne) But first, you take
a survey of the Earth's resources.

1064
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:09,358
You don't leave it up to the opinion of somebody

1065
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:10,718
or a group of people.

1066
01:03:10,718 --> 01:03:12,718
You find out what you have

1067
01:03:12,718 --> 01:03:15,718
and that gives you the parameters
of what you can work with.

1068
01:03:15,718 --> 01:03:19,457
So you find out where
your technical personnel are,

1069
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:21,941
where your water is, where your arable land is,

1070
01:03:22,41 --> 01:03:24,346
the health of the people
and the needs of the people

1071
01:03:24,358 --> 01:03:25,889
and you build according to that.

1072
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,158
That will determine where your hospitals go,

1073
01:03:28,353 --> 01:03:29,753
and everything else.

1074
01:03:30,623 --> 01:03:34,258
(Narrator) A Resource-Based Economy
operates as a balanced-load economy.

1075
01:03:34,358 --> 01:03:36,781
This means avoiding shortages and over-runs

1076
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:40,353
thus optimizing efficiency and conserving energy.

1077
01:03:41,65 --> 01:03:44,399
There would be no excesses and little waste.

1078
01:03:44,718 --> 01:03:47,442
It would be balanced
to the environmental conditions

1079
01:03:47,506 --> 01:03:49,258
and human needs.

1080
01:03:50,307 --> 01:03:53,660
For instance, there would be
no houses without people in them

1081
01:03:53,816 --> 01:03:57,71
or cargo trains travelling empty
or stored in freight yards

1082
01:03:57,158 --> 01:03:59,813
dependent on the business cycle for their use.

1083
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:04,732
This also ensures natural resources are
not depleted, as in our present system.

1084
01:04:05,718 --> 01:04:09,317
(Jacque) Here's where I got the ideas from:
the human body.

1085
01:04:10,228 --> 01:04:14,566
The brain says "If I do all the thinking,
I want most of the nutrients."

1086
01:04:14,566 --> 01:04:16,542
And the lungs would say "Just a minute!

1087
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:20,489
If I don't oxygenate the blood,
you couldn't work as a brain."

1088
01:04:20,689 --> 01:04:23,594
So the brain says
"Alright. I'll give you whatever you need."

1089
01:04:23,594 --> 01:04:29,25
Then the liver says "If I don't filter,
the brain and the lungs will die."

1090
01:04:29,97 --> 01:04:32,205
So, every organ gets whatever the hell it needs.

1091
01:04:32,205 --> 01:04:34,815
And so, you have a system that works.

1092
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:38,562
When you get an infection in your toe,
there's no commitee meeting.

1093
01:04:38,563 --> 01:04:41,715
No democracy, where
they send a committee to the brain

1094
01:04:41,715 --> 01:04:44,25
that say "There's an infection in the toe."

1095
01:04:44,25 --> 01:04:46,597
And the brain says
"We're going to do a three-month study."

1096
01:04:46,597 --> 01:04:48,981
By that time, the infection is up to your knee.

1097
01:04:49,896 --> 01:04:53,724
(Narrator) To achieve the
intelligent management of resources,

1098
01:04:54,656 --> 01:04:59,87
technologies are used to
monitor and track goods and services.

1099
01:04:59,685 --> 01:05:03,274
This is similar to industrial processes of today,

1100
01:05:03,594 --> 01:05:07,679
but updated, to equitably distribute
goods and services to all.

1101
01:05:07,881 --> 01:05:12,326
This is the basis for a
Total Global Systems Approach.

1102
01:05:12,432 --> 01:05:14,736
(Erik) I can imagine an abundance economy

1103
01:05:14,737 --> 01:05:17,85
where robots do most of the work,

1104
01:05:17,85 --> 01:05:21,916
where our food, our clothing, our shelter
are created by machines.

1105
01:05:21,934 --> 01:05:24,901
And I think it's very realistic
for us to eliminate,

1106
01:05:24,901 --> 01:05:27,959
completely eliminate absolute poverty worldwide,

1107
01:05:27,959 --> 01:05:31,189
not just in the United States, by the year 2035.

1108
01:05:31,189 --> 01:05:33,220
Nobody needs to starve ever again.

1109
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,674
That could be an enormous milestone

1110
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:38,282
that is achievable because of technology.

1111
01:05:38,482 --> 01:05:40,633
(Jacque) When we computerize everything,

1112
01:05:40,633 --> 01:05:45,22
and start producing things
and make things available,

1113
01:05:45,22 --> 01:05:47,923
it'll be too cheap to monitor.

1114
01:05:48,7 --> 01:05:49,506
(Narrator) With the most capable computers

1115
01:05:49,506 --> 01:05:53,533
we can arrive at more appropriate decisions
on a global scale.

1116
01:05:53,633 --> 01:05:57,78
(Jacque) I have no doubt that
machines will eventually

1117
01:05:57,78 --> 01:06:00,762
be assigned more and more decision making.

1118
01:06:01,1 --> 01:06:02,647
For example, years ago,

1119
01:06:02,647 --> 01:06:04,419
a pilot would look out of a plane and say

1120
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:06,330
"I think I'm about a mile high."

1121
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,257
But today, they have doppler radar

1122
01:06:08,257 --> 01:06:10,412
and they know exactly how high they are.

1123
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:13,336
So, we don't want human guesswork anymore,

1124
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:14,770
when a machine can do it.

1125
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:19,983
So I see the future as
using very sophisticated computers

1126
01:06:20,17 --> 01:06:21,406
that make decisions.

1127
01:06:21,507 --> 01:06:23,496
Now how do computers make decisions?

1128
01:06:23,662 --> 01:06:26,973
They have their tentacles out
into Transportation,

1129
01:06:27,129 --> 01:06:31,212
Agriculture..., so they can tell you
when the soil is depleted,

1130
01:06:31,212 --> 01:06:32,937
when it has less water,

1131
01:06:32,937 --> 01:06:35,750
because it has sensors built into the soil.

1132
01:06:36,304 --> 01:06:37,998
The computer will be connected

1133
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:41,493
to weather departments,
earthquake zones, everything.

1134
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:45,380
So I feel that eventually,
government will become computerized.

1135
01:06:46,74 --> 01:06:49,256
(Narrator) Today, the world's
fastest computer is in China.

1136
01:06:49,863 --> 01:06:52,2
The Tianhe-2 supercomputer is capable of

1137
01:06:52,99 --> 01:06:56,580
33.86 quadrillion floating point
operations per second.

1138
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,636
[Fareed Zakaria, CNN Host]
Eighty percent of what doctors do

1139
01:06:58,736 --> 01:07:00,529
is going to be done by computers.

1140
01:07:00,569 --> 01:07:02,227
Is that really true?

1141
01:07:02,327 --> 01:07:04,561
[Vinod Khosla, Sun Microsystems]
Absolutely.  I have zero doubt.

1142
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:07,832
You won't want a doctor to do your diagnosis

1143
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:10,128
or monitoring, or pick your therapy.

1144
01:07:10,295 --> 01:07:13,286
That's why IBM's Watson
is trying to pick cancer therapies,

1145
01:07:13,376 --> 01:07:15,310
because it's too complex for humans to do.

1146
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:20,714
There's 15,000 diseases, 15,000 devices,
drugs, therapies, prescriptions...

1147
01:07:21,15 --> 01:07:22,886
You think if you're a cardiac patient,

1148
01:07:22,948 --> 01:07:26,24
your cardiologist has read even a hundred

1149
01:07:26,124 --> 01:07:30,578
of the last 5,000 articles
published last year on cardiac disease?

1150
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,485
Not a chance!

1151
01:07:32,585 --> 01:07:34,128
- But the computer can go through it all?

1152
01:07:34,228 --> 01:07:35,327
- Absolutely!

1153
01:07:35,368 --> 01:07:37,632
(Erik) You may have seen IBM's Watson

1154
01:07:37,632 --> 01:07:40,418
defeat the world champion in the game of Jeopardy.

1155
01:07:40,418 --> 01:07:42,869
Well, that same technology can also be used

1156
01:07:42,969 --> 01:07:46,564
to solve legal problems,
to answer questions in call centers,

1157
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:48,486
to make medical diagnoses...

1158
01:07:48,587 --> 01:07:50,286
These are just wondrous technologies

1159
01:07:50,386 --> 01:07:53,26
that are having enormous implications
going forward.

1160
01:07:53,126 --> 01:07:56,339
Recently, I got a chance
to ride in a self-driving car.

1161
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:58,897
Ten years ago,
I would have said that's impossible.

1162
01:07:59,55 --> 01:08:00,433
But, of course, it did happen,

1163
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:02,898
and riding down route 101 in California

1164
01:08:02,998 --> 01:08:05,55
was a breathtaking experience for me.

1165
01:08:05,569 --> 01:08:08,815
At first, it was a little frightening.
Then it was a little exhilarating.

1166
01:08:08,915 --> 01:08:12,299
And, ultimately,
I felt quite comfortable in that car.

1167
01:08:12,399 --> 01:08:13,452
(Vinod) Humans have accidents.

1168
01:08:13,602 --> 01:08:17,872
Google's driverless car has driven
700,000 miles without an accident.

1169
01:08:17,971 --> 01:08:21,733
Even the best humans have accidents
before they get to 700,000 miles.

1170
01:08:21,933 --> 01:08:25,64
(Erik) All of us are beginning
to be able to speak to our machines,

1171
01:08:25,163 --> 01:08:27,366
whether they're cell phones, or computers

1172
01:08:27,466 --> 01:08:29,609
and have them understand what we're saying.

1173
01:08:29,813 --> 01:08:31,947
That would have been science fiction
a few years ago,

1174
01:08:32,46 --> 01:08:34,957
but now the machines
are able to carry out our instructions

1175
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,225
and even respond back to us
with computer synthesized voices.

1176
01:08:38,402 --> 01:08:43,375
(Vinod) I think 10 - 20 years from now,
there will be very few areas,

1177
01:08:43,475 --> 01:08:48,335
maybe none, where human judgement
is better than machine judgement.

1178
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:52,854
(Jacque) So the computers will
eventually be put in charge of everything,

1179
01:08:52,953 --> 01:08:55,313
except human behavior.

1180
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:59,536
(Reporter) Technology can eliminate
critical life-or-death errors.

1181
01:08:59,684 --> 01:09:03,154
A machine, instead of humans,
fills the prescriptions.

1182
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:05,490
The robot gives a huge amount of confidence

1183
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:07,956
because we know that
pharmacists and pharmacy technicians

1184
01:09:08,55 --> 01:09:09,290
are incredibly skilled people,

1185
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:11,904
but they're humans,
and they will occasionally make mistakes.

1186
01:09:12,4 --> 01:09:16,370
We give something like
3 million doses of drug, in 3 months here,

1187
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:19,116
so even a 1% error rate is far too high.

1188
01:09:19,216 --> 01:09:23,665
(Jacque) So, eventually you're going to
get to computerized government.

1189
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:26,5
And that's the end of corruption,

1190
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:28,866
because they don't have ambition.

1191
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:31,724
Computers don't say
"I'd like to be President of the World."

1192
01:09:31,823 --> 01:09:33,700
"I want to control people."

1193
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,383
They don't have a gut reaction.

1194
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:38,662
(Narrator) If utilized in this
global systems approach,

1195
01:09:38,763 --> 01:09:42,182
we could surpass
the practice of political decisions

1196
01:09:42,183 --> 01:09:45,444
based on power and advantage.

1197
01:09:45,578 --> 01:09:48,568
(Jacque) Even computer experts
are writing books now

1198
01:09:48,667 --> 01:09:51,376
on the 'machine takeover - watch out!'

1199
01:09:51,477 --> 01:09:53,10
They're not going to take over.

1200
01:09:53,109 --> 01:09:55,576
They're going to be assigned to decision making.

1201
01:09:55,676 --> 01:09:59,221
(Erik) I'm not worried about the
machines getting angry and taking over,

1202
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:01,621
I'm worrying about people maybe getting angry

1203
01:10:01,721 --> 01:10:04,883
if we don't figure out an equitable way
to use these technologies

1204
01:10:04,984 --> 01:10:06,823
to create shared prosperity.

1205
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,631
(Narrator) The Venus Project
proposes ways to achieve this.

1206
01:10:11,92 --> 01:10:14,705
Inter-connected sustainable cities
utilize cyber-centers

1207
01:10:14,806 --> 01:10:18,538
which coordinate industries,
transportation systems,

1208
01:10:18,638 --> 01:10:22,283
public health care,
and the flow of goods and services.

1209
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:24,692
These cybernated centers would connect all cities

1210
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:26,928
and help with environmental reclamation.

1211
01:10:27,664 --> 01:10:28,683
In the beginning,

1212
01:10:28,783 --> 01:10:31,841
interdisciplinary technical teams
would manage productivity

1213
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:34,796
until even these tasks are automated.

1214
01:10:37,537 --> 01:10:40,292
Mega-machines, directed by AI,

1215
01:10:40,437 --> 01:10:42,940
could excavate canals,

1216
01:10:43,139 --> 01:10:45,55
construct bridges,

1217
01:10:45,153 --> 01:10:46,907
viaducts,

1218
01:10:47,147 --> 01:10:49,468
and dams.

1219
01:10:49,936 --> 01:10:52,910
Self-erecting structures would be expedient

1220
01:10:53,80 --> 01:10:56,750
in the construction of industrial plants,

1221
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,236
apartments

1222
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:09,978
and eventually,
most of the global infrastructure.

1223
01:11:16,476 --> 01:11:19,857
(Jacque) We study all of the
negative effects before we build anything.

1224
01:11:20,33 --> 01:11:23,509
So there's a whole group of
engineers and computers

1225
01:11:23,659 --> 01:11:27,473
doing long-term studies of
all of the negative retroactions.

1226
01:11:28,74 --> 01:11:30,597
(Narrator) With the threat of climate change,

1227
01:11:30,697 --> 01:11:34,484
we may be forced to take large engineering feats.

1228
01:11:34,571 --> 01:11:38,338
The Venus Project proposes
automated canal diggers

1229
01:11:38,384 --> 01:11:43,9
to bring rising seawaters
into below sea level deserts,

1230
01:11:43,109 --> 01:11:45,335
enabling them to bloom.

1231
01:11:46,106 --> 01:11:49,338
The cities would only use clean sources of energy.

1232
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:52,752
Some say this is not possible,
but even today,

1233
01:11:52,852 --> 01:11:55,858
Professor Mark Jacobson
is demonstrating otherwise.

1234
01:11:56,85 --> 01:11:59,313
(Mark) So, our goal is to replace all fossil fuels.

1235
01:11:59,413 --> 01:12:01,843
There's 30 times more solar available, worldwide,

1236
01:12:01,944 --> 01:12:03,862
over land and high solar locations

1237
01:12:03,962 --> 01:12:05,549
than we'd need to power the entire world

1238
01:12:05,649 --> 01:12:08,140
for all purposes in 2030.

1239
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,373
And there's seven times more wind

1240
01:12:10,374 --> 01:12:11,947
than you'd need to do the same thing.

1241
01:12:13,652 --> 01:12:15,694
So we're looking to combine

1242
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:18,531
all clean renewable energy sources
that are available:

1243
01:12:19,574 --> 01:12:20,794
Wind

1244
01:12:20,968 --> 01:12:22,523
Solar Power

1245
01:12:22,623 --> 01:12:24,826
Geothermal Power

1246
01:12:25,26 --> 01:12:28,840
Hydro-electric, Tidal Power, and Wave Power...

1247
01:12:29,483 --> 01:12:32,541
We would need about 4 million large wind turbines

1248
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:35,180
to power about 50% of the entire world
for all purposes.

1249
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,52
You might say, "Well, that sounds like a lot!"

1250
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,249
But keep in mind, during World War II,

1251
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:42,904
the world produced about 800,000 aircraft

1252
01:12:43,478 --> 01:12:46,684
in the space of 5 - 6 years.

1253
01:12:46,685 --> 01:12:50,545
And the US produced about 330,000 aircraft
in 4-5 years.

1254
01:12:50,545 --> 01:12:52,522
 

1255
01:12:52,522 --> 01:12:55,552
That was decades ago.

1256
01:12:55,652 --> 01:12:57,659
Now, we have better technologies

1257
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:00,605
and abilities to ramp up production.

1258
01:13:02,58 --> 01:13:04,226
So, it really comes down to will-power.

1259
01:13:04,275 --> 01:13:09,76
It's not a technological or economic blockade
to solving this problem.

1260
01:13:09,443 --> 01:13:11,962
It's really a social and political blockade.

1261
01:13:14,512 --> 01:13:18,772
CITIES IN A RESOURCE-BASED ECONOMY

1262
01:13:19,61 --> 01:13:22,348
(Narrator) The first city
would be a testing ground

1263
01:13:22,526 --> 01:13:25,784
for the implementation
and further development

1264
01:13:25,883 --> 01:13:28,242
of these social aims.

1265
01:13:28,975 --> 01:13:31,398
The first city would be a huge research center

1266
01:13:31,566 --> 01:13:33,925
making automated systems for the next city.

1267
01:13:34,26 --> 01:13:35,748
Making the first city better, as well.

1268
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:39,428
It would be a place where
we would disseminate information,

1269
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:40,971
we would have movie studios,

1270
01:13:41,127 --> 01:13:44,17
we'd be making gaming, computer animation,

1271
01:13:44,117 --> 01:13:46,586
a lot of different media
to get out to the public.

1272
01:13:46,712 --> 01:13:48,653
It would be like a university city.

1273
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,611
We would have instructions as to

1274
01:13:50,611 --> 01:13:53,921
what sustainability really means for the future.

1275
01:13:55,96 --> 01:13:57,813
(Jacque) The cities of the future are circular,

1276
01:13:57,814 --> 01:14:00,148
not because I like circles;

1277
01:14:00,326 --> 01:14:04,825
it's because you only have to design
one segment of the system

1278
01:14:04,825 --> 01:14:08,355
and then reproduce it in pie-shaped sectors

1279
01:14:08,355 --> 01:14:10,652
and that would be the most economical way.

1280
01:14:12,768 --> 01:14:15,708
When you build 'Suburbia',
it's spread out.

1281
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:18,37
Then you have to travel one way to the dentist,

1282
01:14:18,197 --> 01:14:19,505
the other way for shopping,

1283
01:14:19,651 --> 01:14:21,215
another way to the doctor...

1284
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:27,856
This system is self-contained.

1285
01:14:29,40 --> 01:14:31,105
There's wind generators.

1286
01:14:31,308 --> 01:14:34,704
All of the rooftops are solar generating.

1287
01:14:34,705 --> 01:14:38,839
All of the garbage and waste is
recycled under the ground

1288
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,467
underneath these roadways.

1289
01:14:40,653 --> 01:14:45,69
All of the roadways contain piping
running up and back,

1290
01:14:45,69 --> 01:14:47,232
and we use all of that hot water

1291
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:51,35
to operate the air conditioning,
and the needs of the city.

1292
01:14:54,237 --> 01:14:56,859
Now, where the residential district is,

1293
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:58,868
if you work in the medical center,

1294
01:14:58,968 --> 01:15:01,224
you can live here, if you choose to.

1295
01:15:03,466 --> 01:15:07,863
So this is, essentially,
a collection of variations in houses.

1296
01:15:10,112 --> 01:15:13,738
Your house will vary to suit your needs.

1297
01:15:16,154 --> 01:15:18,569
(Narrator) Fresco's designs are a showcase

1298
01:15:18,669 --> 01:15:23,681
for the harmonious coexistence
of nature and technology.

1299
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:29,316
(Jacque) Now, some people don't like
living in individual houses.

1300
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:31,788
They prefer living in apartments

1301
01:15:31,788 --> 01:15:33,342
cause there's a gymnasium,

1302
01:15:33,342 --> 01:15:35,808
drama group,
discussion groups,

1303
01:15:35,808 --> 01:15:37,793
recreation of all kinds...

1304
01:15:37,893 --> 01:15:40,596
So, the skyscraper in the future

1305
01:15:40,596 --> 01:15:43,839
will offer more of the amenities.

1306
01:15:43,846 --> 01:15:46,108
(Roxanne) This is your Recreational Belt.

1307
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:48,439
There'd be art centers, music centers,

1308
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:50,950
recreational areas...

1309
01:15:52,244 --> 01:15:54,106
(Jacque) These are bicycle paths.

1310
01:15:54,306 --> 01:15:56,266
There are tennis courts,

1311
01:15:56,366 --> 01:15:58,124
and these are golf courses.

1312
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,463
But the golf courses contain a clubhouse

1313
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,376
with all of the golf clubs,

1314
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:06,323
so you don't have to bring
anything out to the golf course.

1315
01:16:06,484 --> 01:16:07,950
You'd stay there, play golf

1316
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:10,536
and when you're through,
you leave the clubs there.

1317
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,434
These are access buildings

1318
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:15,298
where anyone can access books,

1319
01:16:15,398 --> 01:16:18,109
a violin, musical instruments...

1320
01:16:18,477 --> 01:16:21,639
Anything that they want
is free and available.

1321
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:24,289
(Roxanne) These are your Research Centers.

1322
01:16:24,461 --> 01:16:28,921
Everything studied in these areas
is to improve your standard of living,

1323
01:16:28,921 --> 01:16:30,277
and everybody else there.

1324
01:16:30,477 --> 01:16:32,858
There would be no lawyers,
no bankers,

1325
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:37,829
no ad agencies, no insurance people,
no sales people...

1326
01:16:37,928 --> 01:16:40,193
Without money,
you don't need any of those things.

1327
01:16:40,376 --> 01:16:44,429
So you could go right into
solving the problems that all of us have.

1328
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:45,827
That's what we'd be working on.

1329
01:16:45,827 --> 01:16:49,275
Today, we're fighting over
people who have different values,

1330
01:16:49,275 --> 01:16:51,415
and we're fighting over scarce resources.

1331
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,368
In the future, you won't have to do that.

1332
01:16:53,468 --> 01:16:55,171
You'd be working cooperatively

1333
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:57,544
to improve the standard of living for everyone.

1334
01:16:57,626 --> 01:17:00,714
(Jacque) A lot of people think that
I want to give people things for nothing,

1335
01:17:00,715 --> 01:17:02,126
and that's going to spoil people.

1336
01:17:02,127 --> 01:17:03,991
The fact that you're born in America,

1337
01:17:03,991 --> 01:17:06,100
you had nothing to do with the airplane,

1338
01:17:06,241 --> 01:17:08,347
the telephone, the railways...

1339
01:17:08,347 --> 01:17:11,913
It's all here, and you're lucky,
cause you inherited that.

1340
01:17:11,913 --> 01:17:13,349
Just being born here.

1341
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:14,673
That doesn't spoil you.

1342
01:17:14,862 --> 01:17:17,795
So there's really no basis for crime,

1343
01:17:17,927 --> 01:17:20,740
since anyone can access anything they need.

1344
01:17:21,454 --> 01:17:24,116
No one's going to hit you on your head
and take your wallet.

1345
01:17:24,543 --> 01:17:26,815
Because there's no money in it anymore.

1346
01:17:26,915 --> 01:17:29,313
The Monetary System has been surpassed.

1347
01:17:29,497 --> 01:17:31,797
(Erik) And when we have
that kind of abundance economy,

1348
01:17:31,997 --> 01:17:34,112
most of us will be able to spend most of our time

1349
01:17:34,113 --> 01:17:35,460
doing the things we enjoy doing.

1350
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:37,515
The kinds of things you might have seen

1351
01:17:37,515 --> 01:17:40,870
the Athenians do during their golden age.

1352
01:17:40,871 --> 01:17:43,547
They had human slaves
to take care of their basic needs.

1353
01:17:43,983 --> 01:17:46,290
We can do it with robots.

1354
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:48,255
- Amazing!

1355
01:17:48,255 --> 01:17:50,361
And what would you suggest the cooks

1356
01:17:50,362 --> 01:17:54,888
and housewives of the world do
with all that extra time?

1357
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,407
(Jacque) There's an island called Isle of Man.

1358
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:04,496
On that island, there's a stream down below

1359
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:07,61
and the women wear a harness

1360
01:18:07,239 --> 01:18:09,134
and they go down and get two buckets of water

1361
01:18:09,283 --> 01:18:12,204
and climb up to their home up there

1362
01:18:12,504 --> 01:18:14,415
where they boil and cook food.

1363
01:18:14,554 --> 01:18:16,659
The women have to skin animals

1364
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:20,788
and get the animal fat out
to operate their lamps.

1365
01:18:21,172 --> 01:18:23,329
And if someone said to the women

1366
01:18:23,429 --> 01:18:27,479
"Some day, you'll turn a gadget and water will flow

1367
01:18:27,579 --> 01:18:32,286
at whatever speed you want,
without you having to go down to the river.

1368
01:18:32,478 --> 01:18:35,944
And some day,
you'll press a button and the lights will go on

1369
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:38,746
and you won't have to skin animal fat."

1370
01:18:38,888 --> 01:18:42,107
And the woman says "Yes, but what will women do?"

1371
01:18:43,273 --> 01:18:45,888
People will get engaged in how to live,

1372
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:49,2
how to relate, to travel, scuba diving,

1373
01:18:49,3 --> 01:18:51,902
restoring the reefs and the oceans
that we damaged,

1374
01:18:52,112 --> 01:18:54,303
cleaning the ocean and the atmosphere.

1375
01:18:54,672 --> 01:18:56,110
So much we don't know.

1376
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:58,344
And you can go back to school, free of charge.

1377
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:02,208
And every city will be a university city

1378
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:05,662
where you're updated on what's new.

1379
01:19:09,29 --> 01:19:12,416
PART IV

1380
01:19:12,995 --> 01:19:15,110
(Narrator) We would re-examine everything.

1381
01:19:15,399 --> 01:19:18,895
From our social arrangements
and building processes

1382
01:19:19,274 --> 01:19:20,995
to our value system.

1383
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:24,411
Let's explore how this
new social concept would work

1384
01:19:24,413 --> 01:19:26,710
within a Resource-Based Economy.

1385
01:19:26,811 --> 01:19:32,190
It's not just architecture;
It's a way of thinking.

1386
01:19:35,386 --> 01:19:37,949
UPDATED VALUES IN A
GLOBAL RESOURCE-BASED ECONOMY

1387
01:19:38,248 --> 01:19:41,19
(Jacque) We still have neural lag.

1388
01:19:41,21 --> 01:19:43,648
It's hard for us to step into the future

1389
01:19:43,703 --> 01:19:45,995
without dragging some of the past.

1390
01:19:46,96 --> 01:19:49,35
We won't make the history books of the future.

1391
01:19:49,288 --> 01:19:51,312
We are that ignorant.

1392
01:19:51,546 --> 01:19:56,172
Not in technology;
we're doing fine in computers and electronics.

1393
01:19:56,315 --> 01:20:00,562
But the human value system
is not moving fast enough.

1394
01:20:00,567 --> 01:20:04,21
I would say that people
would be much more productive,

1395
01:20:04,121 --> 01:20:08,139
much more humane...; much happier people.

1396
01:20:08,299 --> 01:20:12,112
That is the question.
Will people be happier with new technology?

1397
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:15,186
No, not new technology alone,

1398
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:17,529
but with a value system and new technology.

1399
01:20:18,92 --> 01:20:21,12
OPINION

1400
01:20:21,312 --> 01:20:24,529
In many instances,
we ask people for their opinion.

1401
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:27,510
Do you think man will ever get to the moon?

1402
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:30,487
They may say "Maybe 10,000 years from now",

1403
01:20:30,588 --> 01:20:35,212
instead of saying "I don't know enough
about that to give you a sensible answer."

1404
01:20:35,312 --> 01:20:36,862
That's the way you talk.

1405
01:20:37,128 --> 01:20:39,312
But they have opinions about everything.

1406
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,612
"There'll always be war,
there always has been war

1407
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:44,438
because man is greedy!"

1408
01:20:44,516 --> 01:20:48,757
That's what they 'repeat';
a loop of what they've heard in the past.

1409
01:20:48,951 --> 01:20:51,212
GREED
- The point is, ladies and gentlemen,

1410
01:20:51,312 --> 01:20:55,242
that greed is good.

1411
01:20:55,547 --> 01:20:58,629
Greed is right.
Greed works.

1412
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:02,795
(Roxanne) People are reinforced
in this culture to be greedy.

1413
01:21:02,995 --> 01:21:05,375
The more you have,
the more you abuse other people

1414
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:07,129
in order to get what you have.

1415
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:10,25
You're looked upon as being successful.

1416
01:21:10,26 --> 01:21:13,492
You admire the people with money
that have those things.

1417
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:18,381
And they usually get it off other people's backs,
that they abuse terribly.

1418
01:21:18,642 --> 01:21:21,563
So, you're not born being greedy.

1419
01:21:21,565 --> 01:21:24,741
(Jacque) People think that
you can't change human nature.

1420
01:21:24,915 --> 01:21:27,809
If you couldn't change it,
we'd still be living in caves.

1421
01:21:27,936 --> 01:21:30,181
So obviously, we're undergoing change.

1422
01:21:30,181 --> 01:21:32,133
So human nature is not fixed

1423
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:35,665
and greed is brought about by scarcity

1424
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:37,45
or lack of resources.

1425
01:21:37,244 --> 01:21:40,428
SCARCITY

1426
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:42,930
(Roxanne) There are some
animals that are very docile.

1427
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:47,98
The cows on the next field;
they wouldn't hurt each other at all.

1428
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:49,982
But when we approach them with oranges

1429
01:21:50,82 --> 01:21:52,177
because there's a scarcity of oranges

1430
01:21:52,178 --> 01:21:54,450
they start bucking each other.

1431
01:21:54,503 --> 01:21:56,952
So it's really a matter of scarcity.

1432
01:21:57,114 --> 01:21:59,112
What The Venus Project is trying to do

1433
01:21:59,113 --> 01:22:01,788
is eliminate scarcity and produce abundance.

1434
01:22:01,826 --> 01:22:04,980
And for the first time in history,
we can do that

1435
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,804
because we have the technology

1436
01:22:06,806 --> 01:22:10,343
to be able to supply people
with whatever they need.

1437
01:22:10,751 --> 01:22:13,208
INTELLIGENCE

1438
01:22:13,373 --> 01:22:17,290
(Jacque) Some people believe that there's
such a thing as human intelligence.

1439
01:22:18,6 --> 01:22:23,870
Remember that an intelligent
electrical engineer of 75 years ago

1440
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:25,704
could not get a job today.

1441
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:29,870
So what you once called intelligent,
was intelligent at that time

1442
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:31,870
within that frame of reference.

1443
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:33,974
It's an ongoing process.

1444
01:22:34,266 --> 01:22:36,934
Now, what is the real meaning of intelligence?

1445
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:42,813
The ability to extract significant
information from any situation.

1446
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:46,905
I would say that it depends
on the next 20 years.

1447
01:22:46,906 --> 01:22:50,689
We'll know whether there's intelligent life on Earth.

1448
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:53,750
It depends on what we do about the environment

1449
01:22:53,751 --> 01:22:56,871
and what we do about the human problem;

1450
01:22:56,970 --> 01:23:03,970
Poverty, hunger in the world,
sickness and waste of resources.

1451
01:23:04,258 --> 01:23:08,970
If we learn how to manage
the Earth's resources intelligently,

1452
01:23:09,313 --> 01:23:14,444
we can overcome most of the problems
in a relatively short time.

1453
01:23:14,521 --> 01:23:18,449
CREATIVITY

1454
01:23:18,633 --> 01:23:22,992
Creativity is taking known systems

1455
01:23:23,152 --> 01:23:26,439
and putting them together in unique ways,

1456
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:29,870
and adding a few things
to improve the product.

1457
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:35,437
That goes for music,
art, drawings, invention....

1458
01:23:35,581 --> 01:23:37,885
But if you study the history of invention,

1459
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:43,734
you will see a relationship
and the tie of all these variables.

1460
01:23:43,886 --> 01:23:46,772
OUTDATED CONCEPTS OF MOTIVATION

1461
01:23:46,773 --> 01:23:50,179
I think that's part of the
propaganda of each system,

1462
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:55,332
that tells people that the financial gain
is the main motivation for people.

1463
01:23:55,432 --> 01:23:57,663
It is that people are interested in money

1464
01:23:58,65 --> 01:24:01,379
but there are other people
that are motivated by other interests.

1465
01:24:01,479 --> 01:24:04,686
Medical research;
people devote their lives to it.

1466
01:24:05,27 --> 01:24:07,772
There are people that work real hard
and save up money

1467
01:24:07,854 --> 01:24:11,261
and go to Africa and spend
all their time trying to help people.

1468
01:24:11,361 --> 01:24:13,202
They're not motivated by money.

1469
01:24:13,389 --> 01:24:18,30
And I am suspicious of people
that are only motivated by money.

1470
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:21,230
- And a $40,000 (US) gold fuckin' watch!

1471
01:24:21,727 --> 01:24:24,230
It's not a healthy motivation.

1472
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,226
If you want to know what kills incentive...

1473
01:24:26,326 --> 01:24:28,919
If you give people
the minimum amount of money;

1474
01:24:28,961 --> 01:24:33,155
minimum vacation,
hard dirty work with no future...

1475
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:35,478
A man that washes dishes in a restaurant...

1476
01:24:35,791 --> 01:24:38,773
They keep bringing a new pile
in every 20 minutes.

1477
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:42,355
And he sees no out.
He can never buy a home or own a car.

1478
01:24:42,447 --> 01:24:43,818
He doesn't own enough.

1479
01:24:43,918 --> 01:24:45,772
So what incentive is that?

1480
01:24:45,879 --> 01:24:48,851
But he has to wash the dishes,
because he's got two kids.

1481
01:24:49,28 --> 01:24:50,238
He's got to feed them.

1482
01:24:50,337 --> 01:24:53,206
And that's not good for mental health at all.

1483
01:24:53,383 --> 01:24:55,651
MOTIVATION IN A
RESOURCE-BASED ECONOMY

1484
01:24:55,675 --> 01:24:57,888
What will motivate people?

1485
01:24:57,889 --> 01:25:02,243
A world without war, poverty, hunger,

1486
01:25:02,343 --> 01:25:05,318
loss of employment, loss of income...

1487
01:25:05,419 --> 01:25:08,476
Your incentives and options are tremendous.

1488
01:25:08,584 --> 01:25:10,397
Thousands of different things are due,

1489
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:14,707
now that you've got your food,
and housing, and education.

1490
01:25:14,761 --> 01:25:15,915
Now, you go to work

1491
01:25:16,15 --> 01:25:18,223
on solving, not all problems,

1492
01:25:18,224 --> 01:25:20,592
but all of the problems of that time.

1493
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:23,657
FUNCTIONAL SELFISHNESS
IN A COOPERATIVE SOCIETY

1494
01:25:23,794 --> 01:25:27,275
So we do it because
we are functionally selfish;

1495
01:25:27,435 --> 01:25:32,334
meaning, being selfish for yourself,
alone, is detrimental.

1496
01:25:32,534 --> 01:25:34,375
But functionally selfish means:

1497
01:25:34,527 --> 01:25:35,785
take care of the environment,

1498
01:25:35,885 --> 01:25:37,988
share ideas with people,

1499
01:25:37,989 --> 01:25:40,785
and in that way, we all gain.

1500
01:25:41,558 --> 01:25:43,677
They can see, on the news every day,

1501
01:25:43,777 --> 01:25:48,67
that everything they do
goes out to all humanity.

1502
01:25:48,464 --> 01:25:50,244
So everybody in the world represents

1503
01:25:50,344 --> 01:25:52,404
an extension to their life,

1504
01:25:52,405 --> 01:25:55,174
rather than everybody selling themselves

1505
01:25:55,175 --> 01:25:57,354
and making a profit on one another.

1506
01:25:57,553 --> 01:26:01,638
They now have the time
to appreciate what the new world does.

1507
01:26:01,796 --> 01:26:05,522
And all of the films of the future
will show them what's happening

1508
01:26:05,695 --> 01:26:06,871
all over the world.

1509
01:26:07,2 --> 01:26:10,916
And what's new, and that
they have free access to what's new.

1510
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:14,759
Because everybody cares about everybody else.

1511
01:26:15,726 --> 01:26:17,933
UTOPIA

1512
01:26:18,234 --> 01:26:22,202
I'd like to strike out the word "Utopia".
There's no such thing.

1513
01:26:22,402 --> 01:26:25,194
It's like designing the best city possible.

1514
01:26:25,294 --> 01:26:26,549
That's not possible!

1515
01:26:26,812 --> 01:26:28,713
We can design a far better city,

1516
01:26:28,831 --> 01:26:31,358
but as time goes on, with new inventions,

1517
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:33,777
it's always in the process of change.

1518
01:26:33,983 --> 01:26:36,157
Are we civilized?
Of course not!

1519
01:26:36,297 --> 01:26:38,245
It's an ongoing process.

1520
01:26:38,446 --> 01:26:40,561
People think "Well, your ideas are utopian."

1521
01:26:40,661 --> 01:26:42,310
That's not utopian.

1522
01:26:42,311 --> 01:26:45,472
That's applied technology and efficiency.

1523
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,463
EMERGENT SOCIETY

1524
01:26:47,564 --> 01:26:51,815
What we want is an emergent society,
that's never established.

1525
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:56,889
Always learning new things;
always moving onward toward change.

1526
01:26:57,40 --> 01:27:03,359
And to help people adjust, emotionally
and intellectually, to expect change.

1527
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:05,26
Change for the better.

1528
01:27:05,145 --> 01:27:07,888
MORALITY

1529
01:27:08,6 --> 01:27:10,292
If the environment is structured,

1530
01:27:10,436 --> 01:27:14,616
it produces what you would call
ethical and moral behavior.

1531
01:27:15,113 --> 01:27:16,992
But if you don't alter the environment,

1532
01:27:17,92 --> 01:27:20,93
it'll keep producing what you've got now.

1533
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:22,423
So, the environment has to be changed.

1534
01:27:22,424 --> 01:27:26,752
That means the schools,
the things we learn, our language...

1535
01:27:26,753 --> 01:27:29,443
All of these things have to be updated.

1536
01:27:29,445 --> 01:27:34,558
I think that people will be
ethical to the nature of the world.

1537
01:27:34,559 --> 01:27:37,817
Ethical, not because it says so in a book;

1538
01:27:38,215 --> 01:27:40,650
they're ethical because it's better for them

1539
01:27:40,651 --> 01:27:42,201
and better for society.

1540
01:27:42,301 --> 01:27:44,583
So the new ethics is based upon

1541
01:27:44,695 --> 01:27:48,608
the carrying capacity of the Earth,
rather than my opinion.

1542
01:27:48,756 --> 01:27:51,887
HUMAN RIGHTS

1543
01:27:51,989 --> 01:27:54,150
Will it be a democracy?

1544
01:27:54,151 --> 01:27:55,746
It never was a democracy.

1545
01:27:55,947 --> 01:27:59,633
It's been corrupt all the way back,
only it's never been disclosed.

1546
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,886
Did you vote for the space program?

1547
01:28:02,226 --> 01:28:04,791
Did you vote for the building of warships?

1548
01:28:05,131 --> 01:28:06,774
Did you vote for any wars?

1549
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,425
What the hell do you mean
by participatory democracy?

1550
01:28:09,585 --> 01:28:12,76
It never existed. These are words.

1551
01:28:12,176 --> 01:28:15,502
Whenever you hear
democracy and freedom, watch out!

1552
01:28:15,702 --> 01:28:17,217
That means it doesn't exist.

1553
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:19,174
In a world where it does exist,

1554
01:28:19,292 --> 01:28:22,439
there are no proclamations as to Human Rights.

1555
01:28:22,539 --> 01:28:24,277
It's built into the system.

1556
01:28:24,419 --> 01:28:26,269
Black studies, womens studies...

1557
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:29,719
are all part of a system
that hasn't achieved that.

1558
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:32,502
EMOTIONS

1559
01:28:32,814 --> 01:28:34,368
In the future, for example,

1560
01:28:34,369 --> 01:28:38,146
if you said "There ought to be
more kindness in the world,

1561
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:40,408
and more cooperation.",

1562
01:28:40,659 --> 01:28:42,351
they would say "How do you do that?"

1563
01:28:42,481 --> 01:28:45,934
If you have nothing to offer,
they'll say, "Why do you make noises?"

1564
01:28:45,935 --> 01:28:49,435
They would not accept that
as anything sensible.

1565
01:28:50,456 --> 01:28:54,27
Emotions are superfluous to the task.

1566
01:28:54,425 --> 01:28:57,863
Your feelings in the future, all emotions,

1567
01:28:57,863 --> 01:29:00,694
will be translated to an action pattern.

1568
01:29:00,863 --> 01:29:03,717
You'll do medical research on how to develop...

1569
01:29:04,57 --> 01:29:06,969
for bones that are getting weaker,
how to strengthen them,

1570
01:29:07,169 --> 01:29:08,918
how to improve the health of people...;

1571
01:29:09,118 --> 01:29:12,329
when emotions are translated to deeds,

1572
01:29:12,461 --> 01:29:14,323
rather than this [praying].

1573
01:29:14,501 --> 01:29:16,983
LOVE

1574
01:29:17,84 --> 01:29:20,99
Now, another thing that really confuses people;

1575
01:29:20,198 --> 01:29:22,365
The word "Love".

1576
01:29:22,617 --> 01:29:27,419
What would happen if you lived
with a replica of yourself?

1577
01:29:27,669 --> 01:29:30,3
How long do you think you'd be together?

1578
01:29:30,184 --> 01:29:31,730
How soon would you crash?

1579
01:29:31,930 --> 01:29:35,251
Do you love yourself all the time?

1580
01:29:35,252 --> 01:29:36,578
Of course not!

1581
01:29:36,894 --> 01:29:38,481
How can you love another person?

1582
01:29:38,663 --> 01:29:41,141
You only love certain things about people

1583
01:29:41,298 --> 01:29:43,548
and certain things about yourself.

1584
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:46,383
The word "love" will disappear in the future,

1585
01:29:46,384 --> 01:29:51,46
and be replaced by a newer definition
called "extensionality",

1586
01:29:51,146 --> 01:29:53,710
meaning to enhance one another's lives.

1587
01:29:53,711 --> 01:29:58,491
"I love you" are just
empty words that manifest nothing.

1588
01:29:58,948 --> 01:30:02,674
It's how people behave
toward one another that indicates love.

1589
01:30:02,741 --> 01:30:05,246
CONSCIOUSNESS

1590
01:30:05,334 --> 01:30:07,525
There's another thing that's very dangerous;

1591
01:30:08,191 --> 01:30:10,998
Claiming to be 'aware', or 'conscious'.

1592
01:30:11,286 --> 01:30:14,520
You hear that all the time:
"At least I'm conscious."

1593
01:30:14,695 --> 01:30:18,500
I usually meet with those people
and I say "Where is your liver?"

1594
01:30:19,606 --> 01:30:20,996
- "Hmm, well, I'm not sure."

1595
01:30:21,313 --> 01:30:24,692
How fast is the blood moving
through your veins and arteries?

1596
01:30:25,145 --> 01:30:29,993
What area of the brain controls creativity?

1597
01:30:30,93 --> 01:30:32,245
What area is responsible for emotions?

1598
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:34,776
What do you mean by consciousness?

1599
01:30:35,707 --> 01:30:40,823
A human being, on top of the Empire State
building, can see a 3 ft. ball.

1600
01:30:40,958 --> 01:30:46,945
But a chicken hawk can see a dime,
and see whether it's heads or tails.

1601
01:30:47,123 --> 01:30:51,981
The term used - consciousness, or awareness -
is limited to your senses.

1602
01:30:52,35 --> 01:30:54,14
So we can never be 'conscious'.

1603
01:30:54,334 --> 01:30:56,147
We can grow, in degrees,

1604
01:30:57,124 --> 01:31:01,634
and understand, perhaps,
a little more about many more things.

1605
01:31:01,734 --> 01:31:04,824
But we never can achieve 'consciousness',

1606
01:31:05,19 --> 01:31:09,266
because we don't see gamma rays, cosmic rays...

1607
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,357
We don't see all of those things
without instrumentation.

1608
01:31:13,362 --> 01:31:15,994
RELIGION

1609
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:20,338
Religion has an old book,
with a lot of myths.

1610
01:31:20,339 --> 01:31:25,193
Packed with myths. And it doesn't
change every year. Consider this.

1611
01:31:25,293 --> 01:31:27,797
A scientist has a book on astronomy.

1612
01:31:27,933 --> 01:31:30,77
Every year, that book undergoes change.

1613
01:31:30,459 --> 01:31:34,920
If you have a book on electronics
that's two years old, it's obsolete.

1614
01:31:35,20 --> 01:31:36,455
So, they undergo change.

1615
01:31:36,555 --> 01:31:40,174
Here's a minister,
with that one book under his arm;

1616
01:31:40,696 --> 01:31:44,665
a real simplistic interpretation of the Earth.

1617
01:31:45,93 --> 01:31:51,822
And it caters to what people fear:
what happens after death.

1618
01:31:55,233 --> 01:31:58,91
(Lawrence) What happens now is that
myths and superstitions are pervasive,

1619
01:31:58,191 --> 01:32:00,641
not because we don't have
better ways of understanding things,

1620
01:32:00,642 --> 01:32:03,956
but because people want to believe things
that make them feel better.

1621
01:32:04,49 --> 01:32:06,278
PURPOSE

1622
01:32:06,478 --> 01:32:11,371
(Jacque) Then they tell you in school that
everything in nature has a purpose;

1623
01:32:11,471 --> 01:32:13,731
like "What's the purpose of life?", and all that.

1624
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:16,538
They say "The purpose of the eyebrows

1625
01:32:16,923 --> 01:32:20,87
is to deflect sweat off to the side."

1626
01:32:20,88 --> 01:32:22,938
That means, there's a designer.

1627
01:32:23,64 --> 01:32:25,307
And what's the purpose
of coughing and sneezing?

1628
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:27,224
To infect other people?

1629
01:32:27,324 --> 01:32:31,567
They say the purpose of horns
on an animal is to protect itself.

1630
01:32:31,767 --> 01:32:33,561
I said "What's the purpose of those horns?"

1631
01:32:33,562 --> 01:32:35,563
They said that's for ramming other animals.

1632
01:32:35,662 --> 01:32:37,716
I said "What if the horns go off to the side?"

1633
01:32:37,817 --> 01:32:39,882
Well, that's for keeping them off of the side?

1634
01:32:40,44 --> 01:32:42,796
What if they go back?  Does that
keep them off their back?  No!

1635
01:32:42,951 --> 01:32:45,454
Animals are born with 'every which way' horns,

1636
01:32:45,455 --> 01:32:47,235
and they learn how to use them.

1637
01:32:51,212 --> 01:32:54,309
(Lawrence) People hope that there's
some cosmic purpose to their life.

1638
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:56,800
But, in fact, science,
as far as we can tell,

1639
01:32:56,802 --> 01:32:59,530
tells us there's no evidence
that there's purpose to the universe.

1640
01:32:59,531 --> 01:33:01,213
Does that mean
there's no purpose to the universe?

1641
01:33:01,313 --> 01:33:02,421
No.  We can't prove it.

1642
01:33:02,459 --> 01:33:05,322
It's just that there's no evidence
of a universe with purpose,

1643
01:33:05,422 --> 01:33:08,450
and the universe effectively acts
like it has no purpose.

1644
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:11,677
Now, should this depress us?
In my opinion, no, because,

1645
01:33:11,677 --> 01:33:14,527
what it means is that the purpose
in our lives is the purpose we make.

1646
01:33:14,597 --> 01:33:17,276
LOYALTY TO METHODOLOGY

1647
01:33:17,476 --> 01:33:21,914
(Jacque) We don't want people to have
loyalty to corporations, or a country.

1648
01:33:22,14 --> 01:33:25,277
We want them to have
loyalty to methodology,

1649
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:29,821
and loyalty to invention, meaning
to improve everything that exists.

1650
01:33:29,921 --> 01:33:32,138
Make them better, smarter, faster...

1651
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:34,632
And make them available to all people.

1652
01:33:34,633 --> 01:33:37,133
That's the kind of loyalty that's needed.

1653
01:33:37,134 --> 01:33:41,72
If China comes up with
a new way of producing automations;

1654
01:33:41,73 --> 01:33:42,693
Congratulations!

1655
01:33:42,832 --> 01:33:46,591
If Africans come up with
a great idea; Congratulations!

1656
01:33:46,735 --> 01:33:50,712
No more loyalty to corporations; to country.

1657
01:33:50,713 --> 01:33:54,295
Loyalty to the Earth,
and to all of the people on it.

1658
01:33:54,423 --> 01:33:57,598
And to make the Earth
a far better place than it is.

1659
01:33:57,599 --> 01:34:00,442
This is the kind of loyalty
I'm talking about.

1660
01:34:00,567 --> 01:34:03,608
This is the kind of pledge of allegiance
that I'm talking about.

1661
01:34:03,744 --> 01:34:06,754
To pledge allegiance to methodology.

1662
01:34:15,593 --> 01:34:18,699
(Narrator) If we manage
to arrive at a saner future,

1663
01:34:18,998 --> 01:34:23,815
the tasks will be about
solving problems common to all people.

1664
01:34:24,112 --> 01:34:29,89
(Jacque) We have to anticipate
that the Earth is our salvation.

1665
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:32,982
If we don't take care of it,
no matter how many churches you build,

1666
01:34:33,117 --> 01:34:35,940
we will starve to death and kill each other.

1667
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:39,878
(Narrator) The real challenges
are producing abundance,

1668
01:34:39,978 --> 01:34:42,927
reclaiming damaged environments,

1669
01:34:42,928 --> 01:34:46,870
sharing and creating
innovative technologies,

1670
01:34:47,17 --> 01:34:50,508
and improving communications between people.

1671
01:34:50,911 --> 01:34:53,961
(Jacque) I know that we can build
a far better world, without war,

1672
01:34:54,61 --> 01:34:57,85
without most crimes,
without the need for prisons,

1673
01:34:57,242 --> 01:34:58,732
and without the need for money.

1674
01:34:58,851 --> 01:35:01,771
We can surpass that.
We have the technical ability

1675
01:35:01,772 --> 01:35:04,586
to make things available to everyone.

1676
01:35:04,587 --> 01:35:08,192
All the wonders of technology
have no meaning at all

1677
01:35:08,193 --> 01:35:12,677
unless it enhances the lives of everyone.

1678
01:35:15,696 --> 01:35:19,491
(Narrator) The vision of applied science
can serve the common good.

1679
01:35:19,854 --> 01:35:24,348
And though this goal has eluded
human civilization for centuries,

1680
01:35:24,409 --> 01:35:27,165
the possibility of a better life for all

1681
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:33,623
will depend, ultimately,
on the choices we make today.

1682
01:35:35,701 --> 01:35:38,670
